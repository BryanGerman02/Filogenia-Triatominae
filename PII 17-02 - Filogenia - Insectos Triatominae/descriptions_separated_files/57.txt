Triatoma sinaloensis Ryckman Figures 170, 171 Triatoma sinaloensis Ryckman, 1962, p. 118, pl. 2, fig.L. This species is so similar to T peninsularis that a detailed redescription is not necessary. Triatoma sinaloensis is slightly smaller than peninsularis (males 10,3-11,5 , females 10-4-12,5 ), the overall color is from lightto dark reddish brown, and the body surface ishighly polished. The slight difference in headshape may also be oftaxonomic importance.
