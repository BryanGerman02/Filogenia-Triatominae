Anteocular region over three times as long as postocular (1:0,25-0,30). Eyes medium-sized, in lateral view attaining level of under but remote from level of upper surface of head. Ratio width of eye to synthlipsis 1:0,95-1,20. First and second articles of antennae dark, third dark on basal and light colored on apical half, fourth dark on basal and apical fourths. Ratio of antennal segments 1:6,4-8,5:3,4-4,0:2,5-3,1. Rostrum as shown in figure 2648; second segment attaining neck. Ratio of rostral segments 1:3,3-3,7:0,8-0,9.
