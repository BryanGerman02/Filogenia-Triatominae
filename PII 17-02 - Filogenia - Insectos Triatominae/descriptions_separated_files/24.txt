Triatoma mazzae Jorg, 1937, p. 33, figs. 1-9, 11-14. Length of male 21-26 , of female 26-29 ; width of pronotum of male 5,5-6,5 , of female 6,0-6,5 ; width of abdomen of male 8-10 , of female 8,5-10,0 Overall color black (dark brown in many museum specimens), with yellow markings on corium, legs, and connexivum. Integument sparsely granulose; pilosity short and sparse. Head black, delicately rugose and sparsely granulose. Head twice as long as wide across eyes (1:0,50-0,55), and as long as pronotum. Anteocular region three times as long as postocular (1:0,3), the latter with sides rounded. Clypeus widened on posterior half. Genae rounded distally, slightly surpassing level of apex of clypeus. Eyes in lateral view very close to or attaining level of under surface of head but remote from level of its upper surface. Ratio width of eye to synthlipsis 1:1,5-1,8. Antenniferous tubercles situated at middle of anteocular region. First antennal segment approaching but not attaining level of apex of clypeus; second segment with numerous adpressed bristles not more than half as long as diameter of segment. Ratio of antennal segments 1:3,5-3,7:2,9-3,3:2,0-2,3. Rostrum as dark as or distinctly lighter colored than head. Setae of rostrum very short on first and most of under surface of second segment. Distal portion of under surface of second segment and its entire upper surface as well as entire third segment dorsally, ventrally, and laterally with dense hairs much longer than diameter of segment, longest at base of third segment and progressively decreasing in length toward apex of rostrum. First rostral segment attaining level of apex of jugae, viz., not quite reaching level of apex of antenniferous tubercles. Second segment attaining level of hind border of eyes. Ratio of rostral segments 1:1,7-2,0:1,0. Neck black, with I+ 1 lateral spots yellow. Pronotum uniformly shining black. Anterior lobe with I+ 1 small discal tubercles, their apex in many cases yellowish, and in some specimens with l + 1 feeble posterosublateral tubercles; lateral tubercles invariably present although small. Elevated portions of anterior lobe setose but not granulose. Posterior lobe strongly rugose. Submedian carinae extending to posterior third of hind lobe but evanescent before posterior margin. Humeral angles rounded; humeri distinctly elevated, convex. Anterolateral projections short and blunt. Scutellum entirely black, strongly rugose, with distinct central depression. Posterior process of scutellum elongate, conical, wide at base, narrowly tapering apically, horizontal, slightly shorter than main body of scutellum. Hemelytra falling short of apex of seventh urotergite, in both sexes. Overall color of hemelytra dark, with corium almost black but membrane brown, fumose, not as dark as dark portions of corium. Clavus black, with large pale yellow spots at base. Corium in most specimens with one pale yellow spot subbasally and invariably with yellow subapical spot situated at apex of cell formed by r and m. Veins of membrane dark. Legs with fore femur from five to six times as long as wide. Legs black, with trochantera and bases of femora conspicuously yellow; in some specimens, a faint yellow subbasal annulus on tibiae and a somewhat light-colored area on femor submedially. Fore and mid femora with 1 + l small subapical denticles, very rarely present also on hind femur. Spongy fossulae on fore and mid tibiae of males, absent in females. Venter convex, very slightly flattened longitudinally along middle, rather coarsely striate transversally, sparsely and inconspicuously setose. Spiracles adjacent to connexival suture. Venter dark brown to black. Connexivum black, each segment with large yellowspot, remote from anterior but closely approaching posterior border of segment and adjoining connexival suture; yellow area brieflyextending on urostemite mainly at area of spiracles.
