Belminus rugulosus:Usinger, 1944, p. 31, pl. 7, fig. A. (nee St41). Belminus eostarieensis Herrer, Lent and Wygodzinsky, 1954, p. 95, figs. 42-48. Length of male 8,5 , of female 9 ; maximum width of pronotum of male 2,3, of female 3 , maximum width of abdomen of male 3,5 , of female 5 General color black, with yellow or orangebrown spots on membrane of hemelytr a and on abdomen. Head two and one1Spanish version of key, p. 482. half times as long as wide (l:0,35), distinctly longer than pronotum (1:0,8). Clypeus with anterior margin slightly rounded. Anteocular region twice as long as postocular (1:0,5). Hind lobe of head oval, widest anteriorly with sides distinctly converging posteriorly. Eyes in lateral view attaining level of under but not of upper surface of head. Ratio width of eye to synthlipsis 1:1,4. Ocelli small but distinct. External spinelike projection of antenniferous tubercle very short, barely projecting beyond base of first antennal segment. Ratio of antennal segments 1:2,0:1,8:2,0. Rostrum with first segment closely approaching level of center of eye, second segment shorter, third shortest; ratio of length of segments 1:0,70:0,35. Pronotum of general body color, its shape as shown in figures 297, 298. Sides of anterior lobe subparallel, only slightly converging toward behind, forming conspicuous angle with sides of posterior lobe. Anterolateral processes short, subtriangular, angular apically . Disc of anterior lobe irregularly granulose, tubercles very faint, difficult to perceive. Scutellum excavate on disc; scutellar process lanceolate, depressed dorsoventrally, sulcate longitudinally above. Hemelytra as shown in figures 289, 299, attaining level of center of seventh urotergite. Hemelytra black; membrane with five yellowish spots:one at base of each vein, one at apex of clavus, and one, the largest, adjacent to apex of corium. Corium over half as long as hemelytron, attaining level of apex of third visible connexival segment, and almost attaining level of apex of inner cell of membrane, the latter not widened subapically. Fore femora four times as long as wide, with two spinelike processes; mid and hind femora with only one, larger process. Abdomen with posterior fourth of each connexival segment yellowish or reddish dorsally and ventrally, light color continued ventrally onto lateral portions of urosternites. Spiracles very close to lateral margin of urostemites. MALE GENITALIA:As in generic description, very similar to those of B. peruvianus .
