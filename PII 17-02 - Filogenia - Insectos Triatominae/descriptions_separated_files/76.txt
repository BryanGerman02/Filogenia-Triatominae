Length of male 33-35 , of female 41-42 ; width of pronotum of male 8 , of female 8,5-9,5 ; width of abdomen of male 12 , of female 15-16 Overall color from dark brown to black, with reddish stripe along outer edge of connexivum. Body surface highly polished. Setae short and sparse, inconspicuous. Head black, delicately granulose, distinctly rugose dorsally and laterally. Head about twice as long as wide (l:0,50,6) and slightly shorter than pronotum (l:l.05-1,10). Anteocular region four times as long as postocular, the latter very short, with sides conspicuously produced at middle, almost angular. Clypeus slightly widened on posterior half, conspicuousl y elevated in lateral view. Genae very narrowly tapering apically, almost pointed, distinctly extending beyond level of apex of clypeus. Jugae blunt apically. Eyes in lateral view approaching but not attaining level of under and distant from level of upper surface of head. Ratio width of eye to synthlipsis 1:1,55-1,70. Ocelli situated close to hind border of head. Antenniferous tubercles inserted at middle of anteocular portion of head. First antennal segment extending distinctly beyond level of apex of clypeus. Second antennal segment with approximately seven trichobothria, three closely spaced at and near base, four more widely spaced along entire length of segment . Second segment also with numerous stiff setae from as long to up to twice as long as diameter of segment, and with numerous short delicate hairs. Ratio of antennal segments 1:3,0-3,5:3,5-3,7:2,0-2,25. Third segment invariably longer than second. Rostrum black or dark reddish brown. First rostral segment attaining level of apex of antenniferous tubercles, second extending to level of hind border of head. Rostral segments stout, subcylindrical, with very short and sparse setae, appearing glabrous, except third segment with numerous hairs as long as or longer than diameter of segment. Rostral organ as shown in figure lOC-E. Ratio of rostral segments 1:2,1-2,3:0,65-0,70. Neck laterally with l+ 1 faint reddish spots. Pronotum black, polished. Anterior lobe with irregular protuberances; discal tubercles distinct but low, subhemispherical; lateral carinae with multiple constrictions, but without lateral tubercles. Posterior lobe of pronotum prominently elevated at middle, shallowly rugose. Submedian carinae very low, inconspicuous, distinct only on anterior half of posterior lobe of pronotum. Humeri distinctly elevated, rounded. Anterolateral projections small, subconical, from pointed to blunt. Scutellum coarsely rugose, with center of disc deeply depressed, lateral portions elevated; posterior process short and thick, rounded apically, horizontal or deflected distally, only about half as long as main body of scutellum. Metasternum on posterior half carinate along middle longitudinally. Hemelytra fully developed but falling slightly short of apex of abdomen; those of male extending to middle of urotergite VII, those of female extending at least to base of urotergite VII but not beyond base of urotergite VIII. Legs black, slender, elongate; fore femur 7 .0-7 .5 times as long as wide. Femora apically with 0-2 minute setiferous denticles. Venter convex, faintly flattened longitudinally along middle in both sexes. Urosternites minutely striate transversally , irregularly wrinkled close to lateral border. Spiracles distant from lateral margin of urosternite by several times their diameter . Connexivum as in generic description . Abdomen dark brown or black, with outer half of connexival plates orange or red . Median process of pygophore as shown in figure 22F. Phallus as illustrated ; vesica heavily sclerotized.
