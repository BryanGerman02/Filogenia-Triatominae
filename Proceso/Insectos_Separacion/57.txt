Triatoma sinaloensis Ryckman Figures 170 , 171 Triatoma sinaloensis Ryckman , 1962 , p . 118 , pl . 2 , fig . L . This species is so similar to T peninsularis that a detailed redescription is not necessary . Triatoma sinaloensis is slightly smaller than peninsularis ( males 10 . 3-11 . 5 mm , females 10-4-12 . 5 mm ) , the overall color is from light to dark reddish brown , and the body surface is highly polished . The slight difference in head shape may also be of taxonomic importance .
