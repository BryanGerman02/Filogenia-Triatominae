Triatoma dimidiata capitata : Usinger , 1944 , p . 54 , pl . 9 , fig . E . Length of male 24 . 5-32 . 0 mm , of female 24 . 5-35 . 0 mm ; width of pronotum of male 5 . 5-7 . 0 mm , of female 6 . 5-9 . 0 mm ; width of abdomen of male 9 . 0-12 . 0 mm , of female 9 . 5-13 . 0 mm Overall color from piceous to black , with connexivum and corium from pale yellow to orange yellow . Pilosity short , inconspicuous . Head rugose dorsally , from slightly less to slightly more than twice as long as wide across eyes ( 1 : 0 . 4-0 . 6 ) and about as long as pronotum ( 1 : 0 . 9-1 . 1 ) . Anteocular region from 2 . 5 to 3 . 0 times as long as postocular ( 1 : 0 . 3-0 . 4 ) , postocular with sides rounded , converging posteriorly . Eyes in lateral view attaining level of under but not of upper surface of head . Ratio width of eye to synthlipsis 1 : 1 . 0-2 . 0 , varying considerably even among sympatric specimens . Ocelli large , as long as distance from their anterior border to posterior margin of eye . Antenniferous tubercles subcylindrical , comparatively elongate , situated slightly posterior of middle of anteocular region of head ; first antennal segment attaining level of apex of clypeus ; second segment with many strong setae slightly longer than diameter of segment , as well as with numerous short , delicate erect hairs . Ratio of antennal segments 1 : 3 . 2-3 . 8 : 2 . 5 : 2 . 2 . Rostrum slender ; first segment attaining level of apex of antenniferous tubercle , second attaining level of posterior border of head . Ratio of rostral segments 1 : 2 . 3 : 0 . 7 . Most setae of rostrum short , distinctly longer but not very numerous on apex of second and on third segment . Neck dark , with l + l lateral spots yellowish . Pronotum uniformly piceous or black . Anterior lobe with I+ l discal and I+ l smaller lateral tubercles , but not pointed and not elevated . Anterolateral angles anterolaterally directed , short , subconical , in some specimens yellowish apically . Scutellum shallowly rugose , central area not depressed ; apical process about as long as body of scutellum , subcylindrical , slightly downwardly bent at apex . Hemelytra attaining apex of abdomen but leaving female genital segments exposed , and in some cases surpassing apex of abdomen in male . Basal portion of clavus black , apical half pale . Corium from pale to orange-yellow , its extreme apex black , and with a dark central spot which varies from barely perceptible to very extensive , forming an almost complete transversal band across hemelytron . Membrane smoky brown , distinctly darker than corium , in many specimens darkest on basal area of membranal cells . Legs uniformly dark . Fore and mid femora with l + l small subapical denticles . Fore and mid tibiae of male with spongy fossulae , absent in female . Abdomen convex below , minutely striate transversally , shortly pilose . Spiracles close but not adjacent to connexival suture . Color of venter from piceous to black except area of variable extension adjacent to connexival suture . Connexival segments piceous or black on anterior half or third across their entire width , pale or orange-yellow on posterior portion .
