Anteocular region about three times as long as postocular ( 1 : 0 . 30-0 . 35 ) ; postocular relatively elongate , ratio width to length 1 : 0 . 6-0 . 7 ; its sides faintly convex , slightly converging posteriorly . Clypeus narrow , somewhat swollen on posterior half . Genae tapering apically but not pointed , falling slightly short of level of apex of clypeus . Jugae blunt apically . Eyes in lateral aspect attaining level of upper and of lower surface of head . Ratio width of eye to synthlipsis widely variable , 1 : 0 . 80-1 . 45 . Antenniferous tubercles situated at center of anteocular region . First antennal segment attaining or slightly surpassing level of apex of clypeus ; second segment beset with short inclined bristles shorter than diameter of article . Ratio of antennal segments 1 : 4 . 6-5 . 0 : 3 . 6-3 . 9 : 2 . 9-3 . 2 . Rostrum dark reddish brown , slightly lighter than head capsule , slender , segments subcylindrical . Setae of rostrum very short and comparatively sparse , except third segment with setae longer than its diameter . First rostral segment extending to middle or beyond middle of space between antenniferous tubercle and anterior margin of eye . Second segment of rostrum from slightly to distinctly longer than first , extending to level of base of neck . Ratio of rostral segments l : l . 05- 1 . 25 : 0 . 25-0 . 35 . Neck yellowish at sides , dark above at center . Pronotum with anterior lobe almost smooth , ridges poorly developed . Discal tubercles in shape of short or long acutely pointed spines , when elongate curving slightly backward . Posterior lobe irregularly wrinkled throughout , with submedian carinae extending very closely to posterior margin of pronotum , their apical portion mediad curved . Humeri with distinct suberect spinelike projections of varied length but invariably shorter than spines of anterior lobe . Anterolateral projections of pronotum large , prominent , elongate subconical but not spinelike . Scutellum with shallow median transversely rugose impression , remainder of scutellum glabrous . Inclination of scutellar spine extremely variable , angle formed by spine and hemelytra varying between 30 and 60 degrees . Hemelytra covering entire abdominal length , but leaving genitalia of female exposed . Hemelytra of general dark color , with subapical reddish spot on corium relatively small , not attaining anteriorly level of m-cu cross vein . Legs strong , elongate ; fore femur 5 . 7-6 . 3 times as long as wide . Fore femora with double row of 6-7 small setiferous denticles on apical half below ; mid and hind femora with one or two similar denticles . Fore and mid tibiae of male with small spongy fossulae , absent in female . Abdomen dark , but center of dorsal and ventral surface pale yellow . Venter convex , distinctly flattened longitudinally along middle in both sexes although more conspicuously so in female . Urosternites delicately and very shallowly striate transversally , with delicate decumbent hairs . Spiracles close to connexival suture , separated from latter by distance not larger than their diameter . Connexivum uniformly dark , almost twice as wide dorsally as ventrally . Genitalia of male with free portion of vesica flattened or slightly concave in lateral view .
