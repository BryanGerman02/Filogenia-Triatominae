Length of male 22-24 mm , of female 22 . 5-26 . 0 mm Width of pronotum of male and female 6-7 mm , of abdomen of male 7 . 5-8 . 5 mm , of female 8-9 mm Robust , heavily sclerotized species . Overall color dark brown , matte , with yellowish markings on neck and connexivum . Pilosity golden colored , adpressed , elongate scalelike , very dense on most body areas . Head dark reddish brown , very densely pilose dorsally and laterally , setae forwardly directed ; surface sparsely granulose . Head comparatively slender in lateral and dorsal view , slightly less than twice as long as wide across eyes ( l : 0 . 60-0 . 65 ) , and slightly shorter than pronotum ( l : l . l-1 . 2 ) . Anteocular region three times as long as postocular ( l : 0 . 3 ) , postocular with sides rounded . Clypeus strongly widened behind middle . Genae pointed , heavily sclerotized distally , extending considerably beyond level of apex of clypeus . Apex of jugae angular , also heavily sclerotized . Head dorsally with transverse impression at base of clypeus and of jugae . Eyes in lateral view attaining or slightly surpassing level of under surface but distant from level of upper surface of head . Ratio width of eye to synthlip- i sis l : l . 5-2 . 0 . Ocelli inserted on conspicuous l protuberances . Antenniferous tubercles situated slightly behind middle of anteocular region . First antennal segment falling distinctly short of level of apex of clypeus . Second and third antennal segments compressed ; second with adpressed setae , much shorter than diameter of segment . Ratio of antennal segments 1 : 2 . 8-3 . 4 : 2 . 6-2 . 8 : 1 . 5-1 . 7 . Rostrum as dark as head . Setae of rostrum very short on first and part of under surface of second segment ; distal portion of under surface and entire upper surface of second as well as entire third segment dorsally , laterally , and ventrally with very dense setae much longer than diameter of segment , longest at base of third segment , progressively decreasing in length towards apex of rostrum . First segment attaining level of apex of jugae , viz . , not quite reaching level of apex of antenniferous tubercles . Second rostral segment attaining level of hind border of eyes . Ratio of rostral segments 1 : 1 . 7-2 . 0 : 0 . 9-1 . 1 . Neck dark brown , with 1 + 1 lateral yellow spots . Pronotum brown , matte . Anterior lobe with 1 + 1 discal and 1 + 1 lateral tubercles densely covered with adpressed setae as are other elevated areas of fore lobe . Posterior lobe irregularly wrinkled and densely beset with backwardly directed adpressed setae . Submedian carinae evanescent on posterior third of hind lobe . Humeral angles rounded , humeral area elevated . Anterolateral projections short , conical , laterally directed . Scutellum heavily rugose ; central depression glabrous or with scattered setae , remainder densely setose . Base of scutellum with a pair of submedian , prominent projections , overlapping declivous portion of posterior margin of pronotum . Posterior process of scutellum about three-fifths as long as main body of sclerite , horizontal , subconical , wide at base , narrow at apex , rounded distally . Hemelytra closely approaching , attaining or slightly surpassing apex of seventh urotergite . Clavus and corium distinctly setose . Hemelytra of general body color . Corium tinged with light yellow , sparsely spotted with dark . Membrane irregularly mottled with dark , dark pigment elements coalescing into large dark spot straddling vein separating membranal cells . Legs uniformly dark reddish brown , stout ; fore femora from four to five times as long as wide . Fore and mid femora with a pair of subapical denticles . Spongy fossulae on fore and mid tibiae of male , absent in female . Setae of legs numerous , short , those of tibiae not longer than half the diameter of article . Venter prominently convex , feebly flattened longitudinally along middle in female , coarsely striate transversally . Setae numerous , backwardly directed . Spiracles adjacent or very close to connexival suture . Color of venter and connexivum dark brown . Connexival segments dorsally and ventrally each with medially constricted transverse yellow mark on posterior half of segment , distant from intersegmental suture . Development of spots varied , in some cases spots divided into two .
