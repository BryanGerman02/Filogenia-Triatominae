Body integument polished . Entire insect with numerous long , dark , adpressed , decumbent or erect setae , except on urotergites and membrane of hemelytra . Head , rugose transversally along middle , with long forwardly inclined setae . Shape of head as shown in illustrations , twice as long as wide across eyes ( 1 : 0 . 5-0 . 6 ) , and about as long as pronotum ( 1 : 0 . 9-1 . 1 ) . Anteocular region twice as long as postocular ( 1 : 0 . 5-0 . 6 ) ; postocular with sides straight or convex , in many specimens widest behind middle . Clypeus narrow anteriorly , unusually wide on posterior half , limited posteriorly by transverse impression . Genae narrowly tapering apically , attaining level of apex of clypeus . Jugae short , inconspicuous . Eyes small , in lateral view not attaining levels of under and upper surface of head , more distant from latter than from former . Ratio width of eyes to synthlipsis 1 : 2 . 7-3 . 7 . Ocelliferous elevations poorly developed . Antenniferous tubercles inserted near anterior margin of eyes . First article of antennae attaining level of apex of clypeus . Second article with numerous stiff , inclined setae slightly longer than diameter of article . Ratio of antennal segments 1 : 2 . 5-2 . 9 : 2 . 6-3 . 0 : 1 . 3-1 . 9 . Rostrum subcylindrical , with long setae on all articles . First article attaining level of apex of antenniferous tubercles ; second extending to level of posterior border of eyes . Ratio of rostral segments 1 : 1 . 3-1 . 6 : 0 . 5-0 . 7 . Pronotum with anterior lobe slightly convex , without discal or lateral tubercles . Ridges beset with long setae . Posterior lobe rugose transversally , with submedian carinae obsolescent , distinctly perceptible only on anterior third of posterior lobe of pronotum . Humeri rounded . Long posteriorly directed setae scattered over sclerite . Anterolateral projections small , rounded or subconical . Scutellum coarsely rugose , in many cases darker than pronotum ; median impression shallow but in most specimens distinct , limited by 1 + 1 distinct narrow carinae . Posterior process of scutellum varied in length , from as long as , to only half as long as , main body of sclerite . Process subcylindrical , horizontal , narrowly tapering apically . Hemelytra attaining apex of abdomen in male , extending to seventh or base of eighth urotergite in female . Corium darker than membrane , covered with numerous long setae . Legs short , fore femur 4 . 3-4 . 8 times as long as wide . Femora without denticles ; spongy fossulae absent . Legs with numerous long adpressed or decumbent setae ; femora additionally on under surf ace with long setae perpendicular to longitudinal axis of article . Abdomen convex below , distinctly flattened longitudinally along middle , more strongly so in female . Urosternites faintly striate transversally in central portion , irregularly wrinkled on lateral half of each side ; microsculpture difficult to make out due to highly polished , reflective integument . Spiracles distant from lateral border of urostemites by several times their diameter . Connexivum wide dorsally , visible portion of ventral connexival plates narrow . Phallus as shown in figure 22G .
