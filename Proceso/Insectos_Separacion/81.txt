Length of male 22-25 mm , of female 24-27 mm ; width of pronotum of male and female 6-7 mm ; width of abdomen of male 8 . 5-9 . 5 mm , of female 9 . 5-10 . 0 mm Overall color reddish or orange-brown , with dark brown areas on pronotum , pleura , scutellum , corium , and connexivum . Body surface appearing glabrous . Head uniformly orange-brown , very shallowly rugose dorsally along middle , otherwise smooth , polished . Head about one and one-half times as long as wide across eyes ( l : 0 . 6-0 . 7 ) , and much shorter than pronotum ( l : l . 4-l . 5 ) . Anteocular region slightly less than twice as long as postocular ( l : 0 . 55-0 . 65 ) ; postocular very short and wide , its sides rounded . Clypeus narrow , widened posteriorly . Genae narrowly rounded apically , not quite attaining level of apex of clypeus . Jugae blunt apically . Head strongly elevated between eyes dorsally . Eyes in lateral view comparatively small , remote from level of upper surface of head ; eyes of male extending ventrally below level of under surface of head , but those of female not quite attaining level of under surface of head . Ratio width of eyes to synthlipsis ( only males examined ) 1 : 2 . 10-2 . 65 . Ocelli surrounded by ring of dark pigment . Antenniferous tubercles as shown in fig . 224A , with small but distinct apicolateral process . Antennae dark reddish brown . First antennal segment unusually long , extending beyond level of apex of clypeus by close to one-half of its own length . Second antennal segment with adpressed setae shorter than diameter of segment . Ratio of antennal segments 1 : 2 . 8-3 . 2 : 2 . 2-2 . 5 : ? . Rostrum as shown in figure 2248 , its first segment attaining level of anterior margin of eyes ; second segment extending to level of base of neck . First and under surface of second rostral segments practically glabrous ; upper surface of second and entire third segment with hairs as long as or longer than diameter of respective segment . Ratio of rostral segments 1 : 1 . 55-1 . 70 : 0 . 55-0 . 70 . Pronotum with anterior lobe light reddish brown , posterior lobe from uniformly light reddish brown to entirely dark brown , in some specimens dark color less extensive , with area of lateral margin and submedian carinae lighter . Anterior lobe conspicuously convex ; elevated areas low , irregularly rugose ; discal tubercles obsolescent , lateral tubercles absent . Lateral carinae of anterior and posterior lobes forming distinct angle . Posterior lobe of pronotum distinctly rugose transversally . Submedian carinae low , evanescent on posterior half or third of posterior lobe . Humeral angles narrowly rounded . Anterolateral projections of pronotum prominent , from narrowly conical to blunt . Scutellum dark brown , posterior process light brown in some specimens , conspicuously rugose , with shallow median depression . Posterior scutellar process as long as main body of scutellum , horizontal , narrowly cylindrical , rounded apically . Hemelytra extending close to apex of seventh urotergite . Color of corium dark brown except subtriangular light spot at base ; adjacent areas of clavus also lighter brown . Membrane somewhat lighter than dark portion of corium , fumose . Legs with fore femur approximately five times as long as wide . Fore and mid femora with two rows of three to five conspicuous denticles each , extending over half the length of femur . Additional small denticles irregularly arranged near base of femur . Spongy fossulae on fore and mid legs of male , in female very small and distinct only on fore tibia . Legs uniformly reddish or orange-brown . Venter convex , slightly flattened longitudinally along middle , delicately striate transversally . Setae of venter short , inconspicuous . Spiracles remote from connexival suture by about three times their diameter . Suture between urosternites II and III obsolescent . Venter reddish brown , irregularly darkened at sides and in some specimens on genital region . Connexivum orange brown ; anterior half or third of each connexival plate with dark brown or black irregularly shaped subrectangular spot , adjacent to intersegmental suture . MALE GENITALIA : Phallus as shown in figure 22F . Vesica with lateral projections . Lateral endosoma processes large , not denticulate .
