Packchanian, 1939, p. 1548, pis. 1-3. Usinger, 1944, p. 56, pl. I, fig.G, pl. 4, pl. 9, fig.G. Eads, 1957, p. 27. Length of male 23-26 , of female 24,0-28,5 ; width of pronotum of male 5,0-6,5 , of female 5,5-7,0 ; width of abdomen of male 7,5-9,5 , of female 9,5-11,0 Color from dark brown to black, with yellow or orange-yellow markings on neck, corium, and connexivum. Setae short and very sparse, inconspicuous. Head slightly rugose above along midline, otherwise smooth, twice as long as wide across eyes (1:0,5), and of varied length as compared to pronotum (l:0,9-1,1). Anteocular region three times as long as postocular (1:0,35), postocular with sides subparallel, slightly converging toward behind. Clypeus very narrow, its posterior portion widening gradually. Genae tapering apically, attaining level of apex of clypeus. Eyes in lateral view approaching level of upper and attaining or slightly surpassing level of lower surface of head. Ratio width of eye to synthlipsis 1:1,3-1,9. Ocelli large, their distance from eyes equal to their diameter. Antenniferous tubercles situated slightly behind middle of anteocular region. First antennal segment falling short of level of apex of clypeus. Second segment with strong decumbent setae at least as long as diameter of segment, as well as with numerous short, delicate erect hairs. Ratio of antennal segments 1:3,0-4,0:2,3-3,0:2,1-2,5. Rostrum with very short and sparse setae, longest and most numerous on third segment. First segment attaining level of antenniferous tubercles, second attaining level of base of head. Ratio of rostral segments 1:1,5-1,6:0,45-0,5. Neck black, laterally with 1 + 1 conspicuous yellow spots. Pronotum of general body color, distinctly constricted at level of transverse sulcus. Anterior lobe slightly elevated, smooth, ridges not prominent. Discal and lateral tubercles present. Posterior lobe heavily rugose; submedian carinae not attaining posterior border. Lateral margins carinate , slightly reflexed. Humeri faintly angulate. Anterolateral angles obliquely forward directed, conical, narrowly tapering apically. Scutellum with depressed portion shallowly rugose, limited by distinct carinae. Posterior process almost as long as main body of scutellum, subcylindrical, slightly compressed laterally; downward bent at apex. Hemelytra in most specimens attaining apex of abdomen, in some individuals, mainly females, falling short of apex by 0,5 to 1,0 Overall color of hemelytra from dark brown to black, somewhat lighter on and adjacent to apex of clavus. Clavus black basally, smoky brown apically. Base of corium strikingly light yellow or orange-yellow, best observed on deflexed portion of base of hemelytron; a narrow line along basal half of margin of corium also yellow; a small yellowish subapical spot in many cases present. Legs uniformly black, slender; fore femora eight to nine times as long as wide. Fore and mid femora subapically with 1 + 1 small denti cles. Fore and mid tibiae of males with small spongy fossulae, absent in females. Abdomen rounded below, with minute transverse wrinkles. Hairs of venter short, inconspicuous. Spiracles close to connexival suture, distant from latter by about twice their diameter. Abdomen from dark brown to black. Connexival segments with transverse yellow or orange-yellow markings, occupying posterior third or fourth of each segment adjacent to intersegmental sutures; yellow spots projecting narrowly onto urosternites. Spiracles light colored.
