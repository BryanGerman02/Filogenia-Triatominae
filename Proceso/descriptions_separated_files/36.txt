Triatoma neotomae Neiva Figures 268; 117, 118 Triatoma neotomae Neiva, 191la, p. 422; 1914a, p53. Pinto, 1931, p. 73, fig.24. Usinger, 1944, p70, pl. 12, fig.E. Thurman, 1944, p. 116Conorhinus neotomae:Patton and Cragg, 1913, p 494. Length of males 16,5-17,5 , of females 17,5-19,5 , width of pronotum of males 4,0-4,5, of females 4,2-5,5 , of abdomen of males 5,0-5,5, of females 6,0-6,5 General color from dark brown to blackish, with orange-yellow markings on neck, humeral angles and connexivum, the corium partially light yellow. Head heavily rugose, slightly granulose, distinctly convex above eyes, not over twice as long as wide across eyes (1:0,50,6), and as long as or slightly shorter than pronotum (1:1,0-1,1). Anteocular region from two to three times as long as postocular (1:0,30,45); postocular with sides rounded, widest at middle, somewhat convergent toward behind. Clypeus narrow anteriorly, abruptly and strongly widened toward posterior half. Head with distinct arcuate transverse impression at base of clypeus. Genae conspicuously rugose transversally, tapered apically, almost attaining level of apex of clypeus. Upper surface of head evenly convex above, but in side view with slight but distinct depression at level of base of clypeus; ventrally not salient behind eyes. Eyes in lateral view remote from level of upper but very close to level of under surface of head. Eyes comparatively small, ratio width of eye to synthlipsis 1:2,5-3,0. Antenniferous tubercles situated closer to eyes than to level of apex of anteocular region. First antennal segment short, not attaining level of apex of clypeus. Second segment with short decumbent setae. Ratio of antennal segments 1:2,3-2,6:2,0-2,4:1,7-2,0. Rostrum with hairs becoming progressively longer toward apex of second and on third segment, forming dense brushlike structure at junction of second and third segment. First segment not quite attaining level of apex of antenniferous tubercle, second reaching level of posterior border of head. Ratio of rostral segments 1:1,6-1,7:0,6-0,7. Neck entirely yellowish. Pronotum subquadrate, with sides carinate, not constricted at level of transverse sulcus. Thorax of general body color, humeral angles of pronotum each with yellowish spot attaining margin of sclerite. Anterior lobe slightly elevated, polished, without discal or lateral tubercles, very sparsely granulose. Posterior lobe rugose; humeri rounded. Anterolateral angles in shape of dorsoventrally flattened flap, broadly rounded and very short. Scutellum with depressed central portion limited by broad carinae; posterior process not more than half as long as main body of scutellum, pointed, declinate at apex. Hemelytra attammg or surpassing middle of eighth urotergite. Corium without perceptible setae, orange or pale yellow with large dark central spot which is longer than wide; dark also base of clavus and apex of corium. Membrane light fumose. Legs of general body color, stout; fore femora 3,6-3,8 times as long as wide. Fore and mid femora with 2+2 denticles subapically. Spongy fossulae present on fore and mid tibiae of males and only on fore tibiae of females. Venter convex, sharply flattened longitudinally along middle, delicately striate transversally, with inconspicuous setae. Spiracles distant by one to three times their own diameter from connexival suture. Urosternites and urotergites of general body color. Connexival segments orange-yellow, each at middle with large dark, transversal, irregularly shaped marking extending over entire width of connexival segment, dorsally and ventrally.
