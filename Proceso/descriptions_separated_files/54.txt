Length of male 21-24 , of female 22-25 , width of pronotum of male 4,5-5,5 , of female 4,5-7,0 ; width of abdomen of male 6,5-8,5 , of female 8-12 Overall color black, with red, orange, or rarely yellowish markings on neck, pronotum, corium, and connexivum. Integument sparsely granulose; setae short, sparse, integument appearing glabrous. Head long and slender, black, delicately rugose transversally on dorsum, faintly granulose. Head twice as long as wide across eyes (l:0,5) and slightly longer than pronotum (l:0,9). Anteocular region three times as long as postocular (l:0,3); postocular with sides very faintly convex. Clypeus narrow, gradually and only slightly widened behind middle. Genae narrowly tapering apically, distinctly surpassing level of apex of clypeus. Jugae angular apically. Eyes in lateral view slightly surpassing level of under but not attaining level of upper surface of head. Ratio width of eyes to synthlipsis 1:1,4-1,6. Antenniferous tubercles situated slightly behind middle of anteocular region. First antennal segment approaching but not attaining level of apex of clypeus. Second antennal segment flattened, with numerous adpressed hairs shorter than diameter of segment. Ratio of antennal segments 1:3 .8-4,5:3 .2:2,6. Rostrum as dark as head capsule or with second and third segments reddish. Setae of rostrum short, except at apex of second and on third segment where setae are about as long as diameter of segment, decreasing in length toward apex of last segment. First rostral segment attaining level of apex of jugae, second attaining level of hind border of eyes. Ratio of rostral segments 1:2,2-2,5:1,1-1,4. Neck dark, with pair of light-colored lateral spots. Pronotum with anterior lobe invariably black; posterior lobe rarely entirely black or entirely red, in most specimens with area between submedian carinae, with carinae included, black to a varied degree . Collar and anterolateral tubercles from red to black. Anterior lobe of pronotum with elevated portions smooth, shining; with I+ I weak discal elevations which are not distinct tubercles; lateral tubercles not developed. Posterior lobe of pronotum distinctly rugose; submedian carinae extending to posterior fourth of hind lobe, evanescent before posterior margin. Humeral angles rounded, humeri slightly elevated. Anterolateral projections short and blunt. Scutellum entirely dark, convex, heavily rugose, basal projections obsolete. Central depression shallow. Posterior process of scutellum short, about two-fifths as long as main body of scutellum, horizontal, broad at base, cylindrical on apical portion, its apex rounded. Propleura entirely dark or with red spot of varied size adjacent to hind margin of sclerite. Hemelytra attaining apex of seventh urotergite in males and in some females, in other females not projecting beyond middle of seventh urotergite. Corium black, with basal and subapical light-colored spot of variable size, spots connected by narrow lightcolored line along margin of hemelytron. Membrane brown, fumose, somewhat lighter than dark area of corium. Veins of membrane only very slightly darker than membrane. Legs uniformly dark, slender; fore femora from six to seven times as long as wide. Fore and mid femora with a pair of small denticles subapically, femora of third pair slightly salient below subapically. Spongy fossulae on fore and mid tibiae of males, absent in females. Abdomen very wide in some specimens , with lateral areas of urotergites exposed. Venter convex, faintly flattened longitudinally along middle in females. Integument of venter delicately striate transversally, sparsely and inconspicuously setose. Spiracles close to connexival suture, distant from latter by not more than their diameter. Venter black. Connexivum black, each segment with large central red or orange spot attaining external margin of segment. Dorsally, posterior portion of light connexival spot attaining connexival margin; ventrally, light spot extending shortly onto adjacent lateral portions of urosternites so as to include spiracles.
