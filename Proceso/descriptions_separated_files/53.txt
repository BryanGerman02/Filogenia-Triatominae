Length of male 19,5-24,0 , of female 20-25 ; width of pronotum of male andfemale 4,5-6,0 , of abdomen of male6,5-9,0 , of female 7-10 Overall color dark brown to black, with yellowish and orange-red markings on neck, pronotum, corium, and connexivum. Dorsal surface conspicuously granulose. Setae short, inapparent. Head heavily granulose dorsally, uniformly dark, slightly less than twice as long as wide across eyes (1:0,6) and slightly shorter than pronotum (1:1,1). Anteocular region about 2,5 times as long as postocular (1:0,35), postocular with sides slightly rounded. Eyes in lateral view attaining level of under surface but remote from level of upper surface of head. Ratio width of eye to synthlipsis 1:1,9-2,2. Antenniferous tubercles situated at center of anteocular region. First antennal segment distinctly projecting beyond apex of clypeus; second segment with adpressed hairs shorter than diameter of segment. Ratio of antennal segments 1:3,8-4,0:2,2-2,6:1,6-1,9. Rostrum with abundant pilosity, hairs short on first and basal half of second segment, becoming progressively longer toward apex of second and on third segment, but not forming dense brushlike structure at junction of second and third segments. First rostral segment attaining level of base of antenniferous tubercle, second extending to level of posterior border of head. Ratio of rostral segments 1:1,6-1,7:0,6. Neck uniformly yellowish dorsally. Pronotum dark brown or black, with sides and anterolateral processes reddish, in some cases also collar light colored; occasionally, red color invading central portion of hind lobe of pronotum. Anterior and posterior lobes of pronotum conspicuously granulose. Anterior lobe without discal or lateral tubercles. Lateral margins of pronotum only slightly indented at level of transverse constriction. Posterior lobe from very faintly to distinctly rugose transversally, most conspicuously so on central portion between sublateral carinae; the latter evanescent befre posterior margin. Humeral angles rounded, slightly elevated. Anterolateral angles short, subconical, or narrowly rounded apically. Prostemum and meso and metapleura granulose .. Scutellum of general body color but in some cases with apex of process reddish, rugose-granulose, with distinct median depression limited by posteriorly confluent carinae. Posterior process conical, subtriangular, strongly tapering from wide base to point, about two-thirds as long as main body of scutellum. Hemelytra variable in length, in most specimens reaching only to basal portion or at most to middle of seventh urotergite, but in some males attaining apical portion of said urotergite. Corium granulose, from dark brown to black, its entire outer margin delicately bordered with orange-red. R + M and free portion of R enclosed in a wide reddish fascia extending to base of membrane, then sharply inwardly bent and extending along base of outer membranal cell. Membrane fumose, slightly lighter than dark portions of corium. Legs uniformly dark, relatively short and stout, with fore femur about five times as long as wide. Fore and mid femora subapically with two to four obsolescent denticles. Spongy fossulae on fore and mid tibiae of male, absent in females. Venter flattened longitudinally along middle, more conspicuously so in females; flattened portion not sharply delimited from lateral convex area. Hairs of venter very short, golden colored. Surface of venter with very irregular miscrosculpture, from delicately striate transversally to minutely meandering or labyrinthine . Spiracles of variable position, either adjacent to connexival suture or remote from latter by once or twice their own diameter. General color of abdomen from dark brown to black; spiracles orange. Connexival segments dark, their outer border and intersegmental sutures orange-red. Female genital region strongly projecting posteriad.
