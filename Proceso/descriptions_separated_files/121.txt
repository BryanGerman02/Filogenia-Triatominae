Belminus rugulosus Stal Figures 306-308 Belminus rugulosus Stal, 1859, p. 102, pl. 6, fig.I. Herrer, Lent and Wygodzinsky, 1954, p. 94. Martinez and Carcavallo, 1976, p. 241, fig.I. Conorhinus diminutus Walker, 1873b, p. 19. Marlianus diminutus:Distant, 1902, p. 191. Female. Length 10,5-11,0 Maximum width of pronotum 2,5-2,8 , of abdomen 4,0-4,3 General color black. Scutellar proc ss, spots at base of membranal cells and at apex of corium, at base of connexival segments dorsally and ventrally and on adjacent area of urosternites, yellowish brown or orange. Third and fourth antennal segments, rostrum, apices of femora, and tarsi brown. Head granulose, granules of various sizes. Head slightly more than twice as long as wide (1:0,45-0,50) and distinctly longer than pronotum (1:0,85-0,90). Anteocular region about twice as long as postocular (1:0,45-0,50), the latter faintly rounded laterally, with sides strongly converging posteriorly. Eyes in lateral view attaining level of under but not of upper surface of head; ratio width of eye to synthlipsis 1:2,20-2,35. Ocelli small. Ratio of antennal segments 1:1,9-2,0:l.4:l.4. Rostrum with first segment not quite attaining level of anterior border of eyes; ratio of antennal segments 1:0,75-0,85:0,4-0,5. Pronotum black, most heavily granulose on fore lobe, with 7 + 7 distinct tubercles. Sides of anterior lobe subparallel, only slightly diverging toward behind, forming conspicuous angle with sides of posterior lobe. Anterolateral processes large, distinctly pointed. Scutellum excavate on disc; scutellar process shallowly sulcate dorsally. Hemelytra almost attaining level of posterior border of tergite VII. Corium approximately half as long as hemelytron, its apex attaining level of center of third visible connexival segment, and approaching level of apex of inner membranal cell, the latter comparatively wide. Legs as in generic description and figures 306, 307. Femora with two or three spinelike processes. Venter with spiracles very close to lateral margin of stemites. Genitalia as in generic description.
