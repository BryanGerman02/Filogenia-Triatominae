Triatoma \ecticularius ftoridana Usinger, 1944, p. 63, pl. ll, fig.G. Length of male 16-22 , of female 18-23 , width of pronotum of male 3,7-5,5 , of female 4,2-6,0 ; width of abdomen of male 5-8 , of female 6,5-8,5 Overall color piceous, with orange or orange-yellow markings on pronotum, pleura, corium, connexivum, and ventral surface of abdomen. Pilosity well developed on entire body including corium. Head granulose, uniformly dark, conspicuously convex between eyes; slightly less than twice as long as wide across eyes (1:0,6) and slightly shorter than pronotum (1:1,1-1,2). Anteocular region about three times as long as postocular (1:0,35), postocular with sides convex, converging posteriorly. Eyes in lateral view attaining or slightly surpassing level of under but not attaining level of upper surface of head. Ratio width of eye to synthlipsis 1:2,1-2,3 (1:1,4 in Florida specimens). Antenniferous tubercles situated on posterior third of anteocular region, comparatively close to eyes. First antennal segment falling short of apex of clypeus; second segment with short hairs only. Ratio of antennal segments 1:2,4-3,7:2:1,8. Rostrum conspicuously hairy, especially on second and third segments; first segment attaining level of apex of antenniferous tubercle, second attaining level of neck. Ratio of rostral segments 1:1,5:0,5. Neck of uniform light color. Pronotum dark, with 1+ 1 orange bands on lateral margins of posterior lobe, narrow anteriorly, becoming wider posteriorly and extending onto humeri; posterior margin of pronotum in some specimens lighter colored, as are submedian carinae and collar with anterolateral processes; in some specimens, dark areas of posterior lobe of pronotum reduced to one wide median and 1 + 1 sublateral stripes, with orange color extending as 1 + 1 wide lateral and 1+ 1 submedian spots occupying carinae and triangularly widened posteriorly, confluent behind with lateral markings. Anterior lobe without discal or lateral tubercles. Posterior lobe rugose, with conspicuous dark setae on entire surface; submedian carinae evanescent posteriorly. Humeral angles rounded, slightly elevated. Anterolateral angles short, rounded apically. Pleura dark, acetabula yellowish in many specimens. Scutellum dark; central portion only very slightly depressed, limited by irregular carinae; apical process shorter than main body of scutellum, setose, tapering distally, its apex deflected. Hemelytra attaining apex of abdomen. Corium with large central spot of general color, with basal and subapical spots orange-yellow; outer border of corium narrowly bordered with light color; entire surface of corium with conspicuous adpressed black setae . Legs hairy, dark, but with coxae in many cases lightened. Fore and mid femora with 2+2 very short denticles subapically. Tibiae of first and second pair of male with small spongy fossulae, absent in female. Abdomen convex below in male, from convex to distinctly flattened in center longitudinally in female. Surface sculpture consisting of irregular wrinkles, delicate transverse striation limited to small areas. Spiracles remote from connexival suture . Venter conspicuously pilose, piceous with orangeyellow markings at level of light-colored connexival markings, covering intersegmental sutures and extending along lateral borders of urosternites; in some cases, entire venter tinged with orange, especially on basal half. Connexival segments dark, posteriorly with orange-yellow spot narrowly extending across intersegmental suture onto anterior portion of following segment; extension of light markings variable. Connexivum with distinct adpressed setae.
