Length of male 18,0-18,5 , of female 20-22 ; width of pronotum of male 4,0, of female 4,5 ; width of abdomen ofmale 5,5 ; of female 6,0-7,0 Overall color dark brown to black, with connexivum partly or entirely pale yellow. Pilosity of body inconspicuous. Head dark, transversally rugose dorsally, weakly granulose. Head approximately twice as long as wide (1:0,500,55), and distinctly longer than pronotum (1:0,85-0,90). Anteocular region two and onehalf to three times as Jong as postocular (l:0,35-0,40); postocular with sides feebly rounded. Clypeus narrow, distinctly but not abruptly widened on posterior half. Genae narrowly rounded apically, attaining level of apex of clypeus. Jugae short, blunt apically. Eyes large, in lateral view surpassing level of under surface but distant from level of upper surface of head. Ratio width of eyes to synthlipsis e1:1,45-1,75. Antenniferous tubercles situated slightly behind center of anteocular region of head. First antennal segment falling short of level of apex of clypeus. Second antennal segment with numerous semierect ciliate hairs twice as long as diameter of segment, and less numerous regularly spaced elongate bristles from twice to more than four times as long as diameter of segment ; similar hairs and bristles on third and fourth segments. Ratio of antennal segments 1:3,2-3,5:3,2-3,5:1,8-2,0. Rostrum light brown, not so dark as head. First rostral segment attaining level of apex of antenniferous tubercles, second extending beyond level of hind border of head. Rostral segments slender, the second compressed dorsoventrally. First and second segments with hairs approximately as long as diameter of segments, but longer than diameter of segment on third; hairs not dense. Ratio of rostral segments 1:1,5-1,8:0,5-0,6. Neck dark, with I+ I distinct yellowish spots laterally. Pronotum uniformly dark. Anterior lobe feebly sculptured, not perceptibly granulose, with 1 + 1 small but distinct discal and 1 + I small lateral tubercles, the latter in some specimens obsolete. Posterior lobe wrinkled-rugose. Submedian carinae low, not extending beyond middle of hind lobe. Humeral angles narrowly rounded, subangular. Scutellum heavily rugose, central depression ill defined, from linear to imperceptible. Posterior process of scutellum horizontal, about as long as main body of scutellum, slender, narrowly tapering or pointed apically . Mesostemum limited posteriorly by prominent transverse straight ridge . Metastemum carinate longitudinally along middle . Hemelytra -closely approaching or attaining apex of abdomen; corium uniformly black; membrane fumose, greyish brown. Legs uniformly dark. Fore femora about six times as long as wide. Femora inermous, with short adpressed setae and ventrally with long bristles, most numerous on fore legs. Fore and mid tibiae of male with spongy fossulae, absent in female. Venter convex, carinate longitudinally along middle in male, almost imperceptibly flattened in female. Venter minutely striate transversally, more coarsely so on seventh urostemite of female. Spiracles adjacent to connexival suture. Connexivum pale yellow, entirely so ventrally, but dorsally with disc of each connexival segment spotted with dark, in most specimens spot restricted to area adjacent to connexival suture, in others extending to a larger or smaller degree to outer area of connexivum.
