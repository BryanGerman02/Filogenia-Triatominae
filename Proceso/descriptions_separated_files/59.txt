Length of male 14-19 , of female 15-20 ; width of pronotum of male and female 4-5 , of abdomen of male 6,5-7,0 , offemale 7-8 Overall color from light to (rarely) dark brown, with pale yellow areas on head, neck, pronotum, scutellum, hemelytra, legs, connexivum, and in some specimens, venter. Integument beset with short, sparse setae. Head brown, with anteocular area yellowish; head rugose and granulose, heavily so on sides before and behind eyes. Head slightly less than twice as long as wide across eyes (l:0,55-0,60), and from as long as to slightly longer than pronotum (l:0,85-1,0). Anteocular region about three times as long as postocular (l:0,30-0,35), postocular with sides slightly rounded, converging toward behind. Clypeus very narrow, slightly widened behind middle. Genae narrowly tapering or rarely pointed apically, distinctly extending beyond level of apex of clypeus. Jugae yellowish, subangular apically. Eyes in lateral view attaining level of under and approaching but not attaining level of upper surface of head. Ratio width of eye to synthlipsis l:0,75-1,20. Antenniferous tubercles inserted slightly behind middle of anteocular region. First antennal segment falling slightly short of level of apex of clypeus; second segment subcylindrical, beset with numerous inclined setae shorter than diameter of segment. Ratio of antenna} segments 1:2,5-3,6:2,52,8:1,7-2,0. Rostrum as dark as head capsule, or, more frequently, with some or all segments very light yellowish brown. Setae of rostrum very short, a few slightly longer ones on apical segment, these setae not longer than diameter of segment. First rostral segment very short, not quite extending to level of apex of jugae, second attaining level of hind margin of eyes. Ratio of rostral segments 1:2,4-2,9:1,1-1,4. Neck dark, with a pair of light-colored spots laterally. Pronotum sparsely granulose, brown, in most specimens with anterolateral processes and elevated areas of anterior lobe including tubercles yellow; humeri invariably with yellow mark. Anterior lobe with distinct discal and lateral tubercles. Posterior lobe strongly wrinkled. Submedian carinae extending close to hind border of pronotum. Humeral angles narrowly rounded, faintly angular. Anterolateral projections of pronotum small but salient, narrowly rounded apically. Scutellum coarsely rugose; central depression well developed. Color of scutellum dark brown except apical portion of posterior scutellar process yellow. Scutellar process large, about three-fourths as long as main body of scutellum, horizontal, subcylindrical, slightly tapering apically, obliquely truncate distally in lateral view. Hemelytra closely approaching or attaining apex of seventh urotergite, in both sexes. General color of hemelytra from light to very dark brown. Corium with triangular basal spot yellow, and with apex also yellow, or not, or corium entirely yellowish with only veins on apical two-thirds of corium conspicuously darkened. Membrane fumose, from light to very dark brown, veins darker than cells, especially distal two-thirds of Cu separating membranal cells, this portion of vein narrowly bordered with dark. Legs with coxae and trochantera pale yellow, in some specimens with faint brownish spots. Femora yellow, with subapical annulus dark. Tibiae brown, darkest at apex, and with small light-colored annulus at base. Legs relatively slender, fore femora 4,6 to 5,4 times as long as wide. Fore and mid femora with pair of stout denticles subapically. Spongy fossulae on fore and mid tibiae of male, absent in females. Venter convex, feebly flattened in some specimens of either sex, delicately striate transversally, sparsely setose. Spiracles variable in position, from adjacent to cormexival margin to distant from latter by twice their diameter. Venter either entirely brown except narrowly at sides, or suffused to greater or lesser extent with yellow. Connex ivum yellow, light-colored areas briefly extending on urotergites and urostemites including area of spiracles. Connexivum dorsally with transverse black marks, viz., a narrow black line along intersegmental sutures, expanded on connexival margin into a large spot; in some specimens, a wider and rather uniform black transverse stripe straddling intersegmental suture. Under surface of connexival segments yellow, with small dark spot straddling intersegmental suture adjacent to outer margin; transversal markings invariably absent on ventral portion of connexivum.
