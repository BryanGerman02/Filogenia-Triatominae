Psammolestes Bergroth, 1911, p. 144. Lima, 1934, p. 1155. Lent, 1935, p. 384. Abalos and Wygodzinsky, 1951, p. 151. Lent and Jurberg, 1965, p. 349. Small, short bodied, somewhat dorsoventrally compressed Triatominae, 12-15 long; general color light yellowish brown, with diffuse darker markings. Setae very short, inconspicuous. Head compressed dorsoventrally, short, only slightly longer than wide across eyes, and shorter than pronotum. Anteocular region from two to three times as long as postocular; postocular very short, from one fourth to onethird as long as wide. Callosities behind eyes strongly developed, beset with setiferous tubercles. Clypeus short, parallel-sided or slightly widened apically. Posterior portion of genae situated below level of clypeus; genae slightly or distinctly surpassing clypeus. Jugae inconspicuous. Postocular furrow obsolete, distinct only as sulcus near hind border of eyes. Eyes medium sized. Ocelli well developed, inserted on protuberances behind above-mentioned sulcus, their distance slightly larger than dorsal interocular distance. Antenniferous tubercles short; antennal insertion closer to apex of head than to anterior margin of eyes. First antenna} segment extremely short, second the longest, third as long as or slightly shorter than second, fourth shorter than the two preceding. Second article with 4+4 trichobothria arranged in one row along length of article, and two ancillary trichobothria laterad of basal one of main row. Rostrum strongly flattened dorsoventrally, first and third segments short, subequal, second segment twice as long as first. Apical segment rounded and centrally emarginate distally. Pronotum with sides carinate; its surface smooth, without tubercles or granules. Humeral angles rounded. Scutellum coarsely rugose transversally, slightly depressed anteriorly at center. Apical process short and stout, distinctly tapering distally. Prosternal groove wide, with well developed stridulatory sulcus. Mesosternum bigibbous. Hemelytra attaining or almost attaining apex of abdomen; their veins normally developed. Hind wings much as in Triatoma, but secondary vein strongly curved. Legs short, stout without spines or tubercles. Femora and tibia laterally compressed, the femora very conspicuously so. Femora grooved longitudinally for reception of tibiae. Tibiae of first and second pairs with short spongy fossulae, in both sexes. Abdomen convex below, small central area on each urosternite somewhat flattened. Connexivum wide dorsally, ventral portion partially covered by urosternites. Spiracles distant from lateral border of urosternites. MALE GENITALIA:Pygophore with short median spinelike process, pointed or rounded apically. Articulatory apparatus with basal plate bridge well developed. Pedicel about as long as wide. Basal plate struts transformed into short curved or convoluted structures. Genitalia of female truncate, last tergites subvertical. Fifth instar nymph:With the characters of the tribe; head short and wide; antennae inserted close to middle of anteocular region; lateral postocular callosities prominent; stridulatory sulcus less than twice as long as wide; femora incrassate, compressed laterally. First instar nymph:As described for tribe; head short, anteocular region approximately as long as wide. Eggs agglutinate, dark, with subapical constriction; operculum flattened; chorion and operculum punctured, without hexagonal pattern.
