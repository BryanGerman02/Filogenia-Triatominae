Length of male 26-34 , of female 29-38 ; width of pronotum of male 7-10 , of female 8-10 ; width of abdomen of male 11-13 , of female 12-14 Overall color black, with red or light reddishbrown markings on neck, pronotum, scutellum, corium, and connexivum. Body surface with short, sparse, inconspicuous setae. Head black, shallowly rugose transversally and slightly punctate above. Head about one and one-half times as long as wide across eyes (1:0,75-0,85), and much shorter than pronotum (1:1,3-1,5). Anteocular region from two to three times as long as postocular (1:0,30-0,45); postocular very short and wide, its sides rounded, strongly convergent toward behind. Clypeus narrow, slightly widened posteriorly. Genae narrowly rounded apically, not extending beyond level of apex of clypeus. Jugae terminating with prominent, pointed free projection . Head very strongly elevated on posterior half. Eyes large, in side view considerably surpassing level of under surface but distant from level of upper surface of head. Eyes of males larger than those of females; ratio width of eye to synthlipsis 1:1,25-1,35 in males, 1:1,55-1,80 in females. Antenniferous tubercles without apicolateral projection. Antennae dark brown. First antennal segment distinctly surpassing level of apex of clypeus. Second antennal segment with inclined stiff setae about as long as diameter of segment, and with numerous short sensory hairs. Ratio of antennal segments 1:2,8-3,3:2,2-2,5:1,4-1,8. First rostral segment attaining level of apex of antenniferous tubercles or, rarely, of anterior margin of eyes; second segment extending to level of middle of neck. First rostral segment appearing glabrous; second with distinct setae, about half as long as diameter of segment, third with setae as long as or longer than diameter of segment. Ratio of rostral segments l:1,10-1,25:0,40-0,55. Pronotum with anterior lobe entirely black, rarely with I+ I small reddish marks between dorsal tubercles and collar, or with tubercles reddish; posterior lobe black, with 2+2 large red markings on posterior half or third, viz., I+ 1 submedian spots as a continuation of submedian carinae, and 1 + 1 lateral spots occupying humeri and adjacent areas; in some cases, markings expanded posteriorly and connected, thus entire posterior margin of sclerite red. Anterior lobe convex, smooth, with elevated areas almost imperceptible; discal tubercles in most specimens large, subconical, with apex narrowly pointed but not spinelike; lateral tubercles well developed, similar to discal tubercles, as large as or smaller than latter. Posterior lobe rugose transversally. Submedian carinae low, not extending to posterior half of lobe. Humeral angles narrowly rounded or angular, reflexed, explanate. Anterolateral projections elongate conical. Scutellum with lateral portions smooth; median depression extremely shallow, slightly rugose transversally, reddish, the red color continuing onto posterior process. Scutellar process short, from one-third to onehalf as long as main body of sclerite, subconical, subhorizontal, rounded apically in dorsal and truncate with upper portion elevated, in lateral view . Hemelytra extending close to apex of abdomen. Corium and membrane black; corium with red spots at base and subapically. Base of clavus light colored. Veins of corium and extreme base of membrane margined with yellow to varied degree. Legs black, with fore femora 4,5-6,0 times as long as wide. Fore and mid femora with subapical pair of small denticles. Fore and mid tibiae of male with spongy fossulae, absent in female. Venter convex, very slightly flattened at center longitudinally in female. Urosternites delicately striate transversally; setae of venter short, inconspicuous. Spiracles distant from connexival suture by about their own diameter. Suture between second and third urostemite well developed. Venter black. Connexivum black; connexival plates with transversal red markings on posterior fourth dorsally and on posterior third ventrally. Light portion of ventral connexival segments extending in some specimens shortly onto urosternites. MALE GENITALIA:Vesica with lateral projections; entire lateral endosoma processes covered by denticles.
