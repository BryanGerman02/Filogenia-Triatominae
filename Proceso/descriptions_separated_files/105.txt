Conorhinus limosus Walker, 1873b, p. 18 (pro parte). Length of male 17,5-20,0 , of female 19,5-21,5 ; maximum width of pronotum of male 4,0-4,5 , of female 4-5 ; maximum width of abdomen of male 5,5-6,0 , of female 6-7 General color light yellowish brown, with dark brown markings on various regions of body and appendages. Head dark yellowish brown, granulose at sides; dorsally with narrow light-colored percurrent stripe extending from clypeus to neck, this region not granulose but shortly setose, rest of dorsal surface of head dark, only faintly granulose. Head about two and one-half times as long as wide across eyes (1:0,45), and distinctly longer than pronotum (1:0,8). Anteocular region approximately three, rarely up to four times as long as postocular (l:0,20-0,35). Eyes medium-sized, in lateral view attaining level of under but not of upper surface of head. Ratio width of eye to synthlipsis l:l.0-1,5. Antennae dark, with apical three-fifths of third article, and fourth article entirely except tip, whitish. Ratio of antennal segments l:5,0-6,8:3,7-4,8:2,7-2,9. Rostrum as shown in figure 2788. Second rostral segment attaining or slightly surpassing level of ocelli but not extending to neck. Ratio of rostral segments l:3,2-4,0:0,8-1,0. Pronotum with submedian carinae and lateral margins light yellowish brown. Posterior lobe with two dark brown, distinctly separated longitudinal stripes between submedian carinae and on each side between submedian carinae and lateral margin. Anterolateral angles of pronotum not very prominent. Scutellum dark, with I+ I light yellowish brown carinae, somewhat widened anteriorly and fused at base of scutellar process, the latter light colored above. Hemelytra with veins narrowly margined with pale yellow, remainder of hemelytron dark brown, uniform on corium, brown areas on membrane observable with diffuse illumination. Legs uniformly brownish ; femora in some instances darker on certain areas; tibiae darker at apex, slender, about six times as long as wide. Ventral surface of abdomen in many specimens rather uniformly dark brown, in some individuals yellowish with dark markings, much as in robustus. Connexivum narrowly visible from below, or completely covered by urosternites. Connexival segments dorsally yellowish brown, each with elongate dark brown spot in anterolateral area, in many cases extending far backward, with pigment becoming attenuated and hind border of spot of irregular shape, but in no case attaining posterior border of segment; spots also visible ventrally. Phallus as shown in figure 238; struts in figure 278E. Median process of pygophore narrow, pointed apically .
