OBSERVATIONS: Laporte (1832-1833) is the author of the first described triatomine genus. The correct date for the description is 1832, even though many authors have accepted 1833. Laportes paper was published in two parts, one dated 1832 and one dated 1833. However, the respective volume of the Magasin de Zoologie contains a statement by the editor (Guerin) ex plaining a delay in distribution of the journal which was carried out only in March of 1833, hence 1833 is the year of publication accepted by many. Notwithstanding the above, Declara tion no. 63 (Opinions and Declarations ren dered by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, 1958, vol. 1, section E, p. 27) fixed 1832 as date of publication of the first part of Laportes paper (pp. 1-16) and 1833 for parts 2-6 (pp. 17-88). We newly synonymize Nesotriatoma Usinger (type: Triatoma flavida Neiva) and Neotriatoma Pinto (type: Conorhinus circum maculatus Stal) with Triatoma. Nesotriatoma, a group restricted to the Greater Antilles, differs, according to its author, from Triatoma by the subangular, explanate humeri and the 1 + I con spicuous elevated tubercles on the anterior mar gin of the scutellum. The explanate portion of the humeri is variable in extension, and tends to be narrow in small specimens of flavida and in the more recently described obscura. Similar angular humeri are found also in the unrelated T mexicana and T eratyrusiformis. Regarding the I+ I prominent anterior tubercles of the scutellum of Nesotriatoma, a homologous con dition is found in the unrelated T ryckmani and T platensis. The general structure of the male genitalia of flavida, now examined, fully agrees with that of other Triatoma. We conclude that although flavida and obscura form a distinctive group, their char acters fit well within the total range of Tri atoma, and do not deserve generic rank. Neotriatoma Pinto, a southern South Ameri can group, consists of two species, circum maculata and limai, which differ from Triatoma by the structure of the rostrum of the adult, with its short first and elongate second and third segments, the third being conspic uously flattened. In all other characters, including the structure of the genitalia, the agreement with Triatoma is complete. However, we have found that the rostrum of nymphs is quite different from that of adults, and much more similar to that commonly found in Tri atoma, with the third rostral segment much shorter than the second, and not conspicuously flattened. Thus, nymphs of Triatoma and of Neotriatoma are not distinguishable on a su praspecific level. We therefore include circummaculata and limai in Triatoma where they constitute a distinctive group. The genus is defined mostly by plesiomorphic characters, and thus is probably paraphyletic. Nymphal characters will be of special importance for dividing the genus cladistically. SPECIES GROUPS IN Triatoma: Usinger (1944) gave a phylogenetic key to groups within the genus Triatoma for North and Cen tral American species, based on characters of the adult only. Our scheme presented below is more elaborate in that it comprehends the entire range of the genus geographically and sys tematically, and also uses, to a considerable extent, characters of the nymphs. Our recogni tion of the several species assemblages listed below is not translated into a taxonomic scheme, because only a fraction of the named species could be examined for all characters used to place a species in its group, and be cause the polarity of the characters used is not known in all cases. Thus, the following ar rangement is not intended to express cladistic relationships.

The protracta complex, however, does seem to be a monophyletic group, its species sharing synapomorphically a peculiar fusiform body and relatively short legs. First instar nymphs are known only for barberi and protracta, but the great overall similarity between barberi, protracta, in crassata, peninsularis, and sinaloensis make the inclusion also of the latter three species in the group highly plausible. Triatoma nitida and T neotomae, two closely related species, may also belong here, as suggested by the structure of the metatarsus of the first instar nymph of neotomae and the structure of the fifth instarnymph of nitida, as well as their relatively narrow body and short legs. The species of this complex inhabit the southwestern USA and portions of Mexico and Central America. The species of the lecticularia complex, T lecticularia and T sanguisuga, both have first instar nymphs without specialized metatarsal hairs, but differ from the species of the pro tracta complex by a comparatively wide body and by legs that are not noticeably short. The abdominal dorsum of the fifth instar nymph of lecticularia has no tubercles, but there are five in sanguisuga . There is no evidence that these two species constitute a monophyletic group. Both occupy a wide range in the USA, east, south, and west. Triatoma indictiva is also in cluded here because we consider it to be very close to sanguisuga, even though we do not know its nymphs. The rubrofasciata-group comprehends the majority of the species of Triatoma and is char acterized by the specialized metatarsal hairs of the first instar nymph. The group occupies the entire geographical range of the genus. The fifth instar nymphs of most species have a row of longitudinally arranged, conspicuous tuber cles along the middle of the abdomen dorsally, but T rubida (southwestern USA and part of Mexico) does not, and, even more remarkably, T rubrofasciata (a species of Oriental origin) has nymphs with and others without the tuber cles mentioned. Thus, the presence or absence of tubercles is not a reliable taxonomic char acter, at least in this systematic area. The inf es tans subgroup encompasses species the fifth instar nymphs of which have a coarsely granulate abdominal dorsum. Three com plexes can be distinguished. The circummaculata complex, distinguished by unusual rostral proportions, consists of only two species, circummaculata and limai, restricted to southern Brazil, Uruguay, and cen tral Argentina. The irifestans complex, with t,he intersegmental connexival sutures of the adult included in or bordered by dark areas is restricted to South America, especially the less humid areas found from Venezuela to Patagonia. The com plex is absent from Central America and the mesic forest areas of northern South America.
The species listed below are included in the complex; species in parentheses are included because of their obviously close affinities with the other species of the assemblage, even though their fifth instar nymph is unknown: Triatoma arthurneivai, brasiliensis, circum maculata, (costalimai), delpontei, guasayana, infestans, lenti, maculata, matogrossensis, (melanocephala), patagonica, (petrochii), platensis, pseudomaculata, rubrovaria, sor dida, tibiamaculata, vitticeps, williami, (wy godzinskyi). The dispar complex is placed in the infestans subgroup with less than complete confi dence. The intersegmental connexival sutures are enclosed entirely in light-colored areas. The complex consists of T dispar (the only species whose fifth instar nymph is known) and of carrioni and venosa. The first instar nymph of none of these species is known, and its discov ery will test our hypothesis of the position of the complex in our scheme. The species of the complex occur in Central and northwestern South America, and are found mostly in mesic forestland. The irif estans and dispar complexes are thus vicariants geographically and ecologi cally. The rubrofasciata-subgroup, defined by the smooth or only minutely granulose dorsum of the abdomen of fifth instar nymphs can be divided into various species complexes as fol lows. The rubrofasciata complex is characterized by the intricate microsculpture of the venter of the adult, forming minute meandering or laby rinthine structures. The nymphs of T amicitiae, bouvieri, leopoldi, migrans, pugasi, and sinica are not known, but the species are Ori ental as are rubrofasciata (secondarily pantropi cal) and cavernicola. The highly derived integumental structure shared by all components suggests that this is a monophyletic as semblage. The phyllosoma complex is a closely knit assemblage of large Mexican species with un usually wide abdomen and conspicuous thoracic tubercles (Triatoma longipennis, mazzottii, pal lidipennis, phyllosoma, and picturata). Tri atoma mexicana may also belong here because its female has an unusually wide abdomen though the male has not; no nymphs of this species are known so that this hypothesis can not yet be corroborated. Triatoma dimidiata, ranging from Mexico to Peru, is superficially somewhat similar to the species of the phyl losoma group and agrees in the features of the abdomen of the fifth instar nymph, but the first instar nymph has not been examined. The spinolai complex, a small, tax onomically isolated and distributionally mar ginal group, inhabits semiarid areas of southern South America. The species included are T spinolai (central and northern Chile) and the central and western Argentinian T eratyrusifor mis and breyeri. The species share with others of the rubrofasciata subgroup a minutely granulose abdominal dorsum in the fifth instar nymphs. The adults of the three species share synapomorphically a longitudinally carinate metasternum limited posteriorly by a straight transverse ridge, a second antennal segment with setae of two conspicuously different types, and extremely fine transverse striation on the urosternites. However, whereas the fifth instar nymph of spinolai does not seem to have any median dorsal tubercles, these are well devel oped in eratyrusiformis (nymph of breyeri un known). Also, while the male genitalia of eratyrusiformis and breyeri are of simple struc ture, those of spinolai are more complex, al though still within the framework of the overall structure of the phallus in the Triatomini. Fur thermore, T spinolai is unique among tri atomines due to the existence of micropterous forms. Knowledge of the fifth instar nymph of T breyeri is required before the phylogenetic relationships of these three species can be es tablished. The small flavida complex, characterized mainly by the two anterior projections of the scutellum, is restricted to the Greater Antilles, viz., Cuba (flavida) and Jamaica (obscura); these are the two only native Triatoma of the Antilles. Triatoma recurva and T gerstaeckeri, rela tively large species with slender legs, occur in the southwestern USA and in parts of Mexico. First instar nymphs are not well known. The dorsum of the abdomen of fifth instar nymphs is minutely granulose and has a series of five median tubercles. We have no evidence to indicate that this is a monophyletic group. Triatoma nigromaculata, from Venezuela, is very similar chromatically to the species of the dispar complex but differs by the delicately granulose abdomen of the nfth instar nymph, coarsely granulose in dispar. The preceding schematic arrangement of the species of Triatoma leaves several species un accounted for. The Brazilian T oliveirai and the Paraguayan T guazu are known from adults only. They may belong in the inf es tans com plex but are phenetically quite distinct from species of that assemblage. Knowledge of nymphs is required before a definite assignment can be made. The Central American T ryckmani is isolated phenetically as is the Mex ican hegneri. In both cases, examination of nymphs is necessary before the species can be placed in the scheme.

DISTRIBUTION: Brazil (Alagoas, Bahia, Ceara, Goias, Minas Gerais, Paraiba, Pemam buco, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte). BIOLOGY: Triatoma brasiliensis has in many cases been found infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, and, being frequently domestic, is the second most important vector of Chagas dis ease in the caatinga, the semiarid zone of northeastern Brazil. In the wild, the species is found in hollow spaces between and under rocks where the large rodent Cerodon rupestris finds shelter. Another rodent, Cavia aperea, is also a host for T brasiliensis. Wild rats caught in traps were frequently found to be a blood source for this species of triatornine, which even has been reported to suck the blood of goats. 0BSERV A TION: Melanie forms of this species which occur in various areas have been de scribed as two different subspecies, but inter grading forms are frequent.

TYPE: Instituto Butantan, Sao Paulo. DISTRIBUTION: Brazil (Goias). BIOLOGY: The species is based upon specimens found dead in human habitations. The sylvatic habits of T deanei are unknown. 0BSERVA TIONS: Triatoma deanei is close to T williami with which it is sympatric; it differs from the latter species by its slightly but dis tinctly wider head , the longer and more numerous setae of the ros trum, the light-colored trochantera and femora bases, the small but distinct discal and lateral tubercles of the fore lobe of the pronotum, and the darker central portion of the corium. We have examined fifth instar nymphs described by Galvao and Fuentes (1971). As in the adults, the head of the nymph identified as T deanei is stouter than in williami. The legs of the nymphs identified as T williami are uniformly dark, whereas in the nymphs of deanei the apex of the coxae and the entiretrochantera are distinctly lighter colored than the remainder of the legs. We have entertained the idea that T deanei might represent a hybrid between T williami and T irif estans, both of which occur together in houses; deanei is chromatically and morphologically intermediate between the two hy pothesized parent species. Triatoma deanei shares with inf es tans the differential characters enumerated above; it shares with williami the slender body and legs, and the peculiar connex ival pattern. Additional fieldwork and labora tory studies are necessary to elucidate this point.

DISTRIBUTION: Argentina (Catamarca, Chae?,. C6rdoba, Formosa, Jujuy, La Pampa, La R10Ja, Salta, Santiago del Estero); Paraguay; Uruguay. The species has not been reported from Uru guay before; we have examined one male and one female from Artigas, Tomas Gomensoro, May 7, 1968, K. K. Gunther and C. S. Car bonell. These specimens are blackish, as opposed to the normally dark reddish brown specimens from Argentina.
BIOLOGY: Triatoma delpontei has been found naturally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. The species is basically omithophilic, and has been found most frequently in nests of the parrot Myopsitta monacha cotorra (Vieillot) where it normally feeds on the birds; however, nests abandoned by the birds may continue to harbor T delpontei which then feed on small rodents or didelphids that take over the nests. Material from Uruguay now examined by us was collected in nests of Phacellodomus sp. (Furnariidae), nests of a construction similar to those of Myopsitta. The eggs of T delpontei are glued to the substratum, e.g., pieces forming the birds nests; this prevents the eggs from falling to the ground.

DISTRIBUTION: Belize; Colombia; Costa Rica; Ecuador; Guatemala; Honduras; Mexico (Campeche, Chiapas, Jalisco, Tabasco, San Luis Potosi, Puebla, Quintana Roo, Veracruz, Yucatan); Nicaragua; Panama; Peru; San Sal vador; Venezuela. BIOLOGY: Triatoma dimidiata has been found naturally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. It is attracted to light, frequently domestic and peridomestic, and has been shown to be an important vector of Chagas disease in Central America, Ecuador, and Peru. In the field, the species has been found in armadillo burrows. In houses, nymphs of T dimidiata have been observed to cover themselves with soil particles; similar behavior has been recorded for the reduviine reduviid Reduvius personatus and in the field (personal observ .) for the redu viine Leogorrus sp. 0BSERV A TIONS: Triatoma dimidiata is a highly variable species as regards the overall size, the extension of the dark spot in the mid dle of the corium, the degree of darkening of the membrane, and especially the relative measurements of the head and eyes. We have measured 160 specimens from the entire range of the species and have found that the char acters used by Usinger (1941, 1944) to distin guish dimidiata, maculipennis, and capitata as species or even as subspecies do not hold up when enough specimens are examined. Total size increases gradully from north to south within the range of the species but with many exceptions. The ratio length of head to width of head across eyes fluctuates between 1:0.4 and 1:0.6, with the head becoming relatively longer (and the eyes smaller) from north to south, being shortest in some Mexican specimens (maculipennis) and longest in Colombian material (capitata), but becoming shorter again in Ecuador and Peru. Usinger (1941) has already stated that the extension of the corial markings approaches a continuum. It is in teresting to note that extensive dark markings are found only in Mexican specimens but Biagi (1956) observed in a single Mexican population toda la variaczon cromatica en el corium, desde una pequefia mancha negra hasta una gran mancha que lo cubre casi totalmente.
According to the available evidence, Tri atoma dimidiata, although highly variable chro matically and in body proportions, has not segregated into clearly separable allopatric pop ulations; the observable differences are roughly clinal in nature, but many specimens are difficult to place. The only exception is that specimens with large corial markings are restricted to Mexico, where they occur together with morphological similar specimens which have intermediate sized or small markings. We have studied a population sample from the cave of Lanquin, Alta Vera Paz, Guatemala, collected by R. D. Mitchell. There are five specimens which agree closely with each other in their large although not exceptional size of (o29 mm, <i?33 mm), the pale membrane which is not darker than the corium, and the comparatively very small eyes and ocelli, with the former in the female not attaining the level of the undersurface of the head, and the latter removed from the hind margin of the eyes by several times their diam eter, the longer anteocular portion of the head (approximately four times as long as the poste rior), the postocular region with its sides subparallel and not rounded, the comparatively longer first antennal segment which surpasses the level of the apex of the clypeus, the anten nal ratio being 1:2.5:2.2:2.3. Many of these characters (diminished pigmentation, reduction in size of eyes and ocelli, longer head) are similar to conditions found in other cave adapted arthropods. A specimen of T dimidiata collected by S. and J. Peck in Cave C, Rio Frio, Augustine, Belize, is identical phenotypically with the specimens from Lanqufn Cave. It is not surprising that such a genetically labile species as T dimidiata would react to the cave habitat so strikingly and in identical fashion in two quite distinct cave systems.

TYPES: Of eratyrusiformis: Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales; of ninoi: unknown. DISTRIBUTION: Argentina (Catamarca, Chubut, C6rdoba, La Pampa, La Rioja, Men doza, Neuquen, Rfo Negro, San Juan, San Luis, Salta, Tucuman). BIOLOGY: Specimens of T eratyrusiformis have been found naturally infected with Try panosoma cruzi. This is basically a sylvatic species, but also found in peridomestic situa tions (corrals, chicken houses) and occasionally attracted to light. Adults have even been col lected in houses, but the species is not known to colonize in human habitations. Sylvatic spec imens have been found among rocks and in stone walls, near resting places of rodents and edentates. The species has been reported from burrows of Microcavia australis (I. Geoffroy and DOrbigny). OBSERVATIONS: This is a highly variable species as regards its overall color and the color of the connexivum, the appearance of the integument on head and thorax, the degree of development of the humeral angles, the shape of the anterolateral projection of the pronotum, the number of long setae of the mid and hind femora, the time of development from egg to adult, and even biochemical characters. Carcavallo et al. (1964) described Triatoma ninoi (as nifloi) from a locality in the Argentin ian province of C6rdoba. According to the authors, ninoi differs from eratyrusiformis by the humeral angles which are not laterally pro jecting and spinelike, the intensive overall black color (a character subject to the state of preservation of the specimen), the absence of long setae on the mid and hind femora, the yellow spots of the connexivum, the structure of the chorion of the egg (insufficiently illus trated and not described), and the different gen italia, viz., the basal plates, the base and the aedeagus, as well as the setae of the parameres. Mariluis (1974) reexamined the male genitalia of eratyrusiformis and ninoi as well as those of the related breyeri. Although Mariluis enumer ated differences between the first two species, his drawings do not confirm these differences. We ourselves have dissected the male genitalia of a specimen of ninoi from the type locality, determined by its authors, and those of a typi cal eratyrusiformis, viz., an individual with conspicuously spiniform humeral angles and have found the genitalia of these specimens to be fully identical.
Among six specimens from the type locality of ninoi now examined, four have pale yellow connexival spots, but in the remaining two the spots are tinged with orange. In most erat yrusiformis from other localities now examined, orange is the predominant color of the connex ival spots, but specimens with yellow spots also occur. While it is true that the humeral angles of specimens from the type locality of ninoi are much less salient than those of eratyrusiformis as originally described, transitions exist be tween the two extremes and in the absence of other clearcut differential characters it is impossible to place every specimen with certainty either in eratyrusiformis or ninoi; we therefore conclude that the shape of the humeral angles is not specific. The same applies to the number of long setae on the mid and hind femora, very low or nil in specimens from the type locality of ninoi but variable in other specimens; this variability is not correlated with the degree of development of the humeral angles. We do not exclude the pos sibility that a careful analysis of the distribution of such characters as body size, the degree of development of the humeral angles, the number of long setae on the mid and hind femora, and the color of the connexivum may show correla tion of these parameters with geographical dis tribution, but this has not yet been proven.
Carcavallo and Martinez (1972) indicated different average development times for these bugs, with much slower development in erat yrusiformis than in ninoi. Interestingly enough, Abalos and Wygodzinsky (1951) had previously called attention to the extremely slow develop ment in eratyrusiformis, but, unfortunately for the defenders of the distinctiveness of erat yrusiformis and ninoi, a reexamination of Abalos and Wygodzinskys material shows it to fit the concept of ninoi rather than that of eraty rusif ormis. It must be concluded that erat yrusiformis contains different populations distinguishable by their life cycles but that this variation is apparently not correlated with somatic characters. Considering the above, and taking into ac count the absence of correlated morphological gaps between eratyrusiformis and ninoi, we find it necessary to synonymize ninoi with erat yrusiformis.

TYPES: Of flavida, National Museum of Nat ural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washing ton, D. C.; of bruneri, California Academy of Sciences. DISTRIBUTION: Cuba. BIOLOGY: Triatoma flavida occurs in human habitations in the countryside, and has been found near beds (Dr. F. Sotolongo, in Litt.) but we do not know of any record indicating that it actually colonizes in houses. Although the nat ural host of this triatomine is not known with certainty, there are indications that T flavida is associated with the rodent Capromys pilorides (Say) (Dr. F. Sotolongo, in litt.). OBSERVATIONS: Usinger (1944) redescribed Triatoma flavida (as Nesotriatoma flavida) and described as new Nesotriatoma bruneri, based on such differential characters as overall size, the relative length of the first antennal segment, the size of the eyes, and the absence or pres ence of spongy fossulae on the fore legs of the female. However, two years later the same author (Usinger, 1946), having examined additional material of this complex, synonymized his own species with the older one. We accept this synonymy, but suggest that additional col lecting complemented by rearing experiments is desirable in order to evaluate correctly the sig nificance of the unusual variability in this com plex.

BIOLOGY: Triatoma gerstaeckeri has been found naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. The natural hosts of this species are woodrats; T gerstaeckeri occurs in nests of Neotoma micropus micropus Baird (Texas) and N. micropus canescens J. A. Allen (Mexico). The species has also been reported from a shelter of Didelphis marsupialis californica Bennett, from a crows nest, and feeding on a colubrid snake (Drymarchon corais [Boie]). Triatoma gerstaeckeri occurs in peridomestic situationssuch as chickenhouses, pigsties, horse stables and horse and cattle corrals. Adult specimens have on occasion been found in large numbers in human habitations, but the species does not colonize in houses.
0BSERVA TION: Small specimens of T gerstaeckeri resemble the partially sympatric Triatoma indictiva; the species can be distin guished as shown in our key to the Mexican species of Triatoma.

DISTRIBUTION: Argentina (Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Chaco, C6rdoba, Jujuy, La Pampa, La Rioja, Mendoza, Salta, San Juan, San Luis, Santiago del Estero, Santa Fe, Tucuman); Bolivia; Paraguay. BIOLOGY: Triatoma guasayana has been found naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, and is potentially an important vector of Chagas disease because it colonizes in human habitations, side by side with Triatoma infestans or Triatoma sordida. Triatoma guasayana also occurs frequently in peridomes tic situations, such as in chicken houses, pigeon coops, and goat and other corrals. The species is found in sylvatic conditions under loose bark of trees and between cactus trunks, under rocks together with rodents and toads (Buf o arenarum Hensel), under trunks of fallen trees where geckos also occur, and finally in nests of birds. The eggs are laid loose.

DISTRIBUTION: Paraguay. BIOLOGY: Unknown. D1scuss10N: Even though T guazu is known only from a single specimen, we do not hesi tate to describe it as new, because the combina tion of its characters is such as to exclude its inclusion in any described species. ETYMOLOGY: The specific name is taken from the guarani guazu, large, in allusion to the large size of this species.

TYPES: Of incrassata, California Academy of Sciences; of apachensis, Los Angeles County Museum. DISTRIBUTION: Mexico (Valle de Mexico, Sonora); USA (Arizona). BIOLOGY: Unknown. OBSERVATIONS: We have examined the type of incrassata, as well as a specimen from Ari zona (Santa Rita Mountains, from where T incrassata apachensis was described). The comparison of the descriptions of incrassata and of incrassata apachensis or of the actual specimens does not permit any distinction be tween the nominate subspecies and apachensis. The size differences (17.5 mm in the male of i. incrassata, and 19.8 mm in the female of i. apachensis) fall well within the size difference to be expected between the two sexes ( ourfemale from Arizona is only 18 mm longl) and the color differences (brown for i. incrassata and black for i. apachensis) fall within the range of pigment intensity to be expected among specimens kept for different times in collections. We conclude that Triatoma in crassata incrassata and T i. apachensis are identical.

C.; of occidentalis, California Acad emy of Sciences. DISTRIBUTION: U. S. A. (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas); Mexico (Sinaloa, Chihuahua). BIOLOGY: This species has been reported from woodrat nests, but has not been found naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. OBSERVATIONS: U singer ( 1944) considered indictiva and occidentalis as subspecies of san guisuga but no reasons were given. We have found that indictiva differs constantly from san guisuga and its other named subspecies (am bigua and texana) by its color pattern; intermediate specimens have not been found. Available distribution records for Texas furthermore show indictiva and sanguisuga to be at least parapatric if not sympatric in part of their ranges, and we have found no evidence of intergrading forms. Usingers subspecies occidentalis differs from indictiva only by its larger eyes (they are distinctly wider than or as wide as the synthlipsis in occidentalis but distinctly narrower than the synth lipsis in typical indictiva ). Occi dentalis has only been found on the west coast of Mexico (Mazatlan), and probably represents the southern limit of the range of indictiva. The relative eye size, not correlated with any other characters, does not deserve taxonomic recogni tion, at least until representatives from the total range of indictiva have been examined; we as sume that the occurrences on the Mexican west coast are connected to what seems to be the main range of indictiva , from Arizona to Texas.

DISTRIBUTION: Argentina (Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Chaco, Chubut, Cordoba, Cor rientes, Entre Rfos, Formosa, Jujuy, La Pampa, La Rioja, Mendoza, Misiones, Neuquen, Rfo Negro, Salta, San Luis, San Juan, Santiago del Estero, Santa Fe, Tucuman); Bolivia; Brazil (Alagoas, Bahia, Goias, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Parana, Pemambuco, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, Sao Paulo, Santa Catarina); Chile; Ecuador; Paraguay; Peru; Uruguay. This species occupies a very large area in South America south of the equator, reaching 46 35 S (between the Argentinian provinces of Chubut and Santa Cruz). Altitudes of 4100 meters are reached by T infestans in Bolivia. Part of the actual range of the species is doubt lessly due to dispersal through man; T inf es tans has on various occasions been found in travelers luggage. BIOLOGY: Triatoma infestans is predomi nantly domestic and peridomestic, and is only occasionally found in sylvatic conditions. The species is very frequently infected naturally by Trypanosoma cruzi, and is considered to be the main vector of Chagas disease in all of southern South America. The species colonizes human habitations where it hides during daytime in cracks in the walls, in thatch roofs, among clothing, in boxes and trunks filled with miscellaneous objects and under mattresses, like the common bed bug. The bugs emerge at night to feed on humans, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, or whatever other warmblooded vertebrates share the habitation. Peridomestically, the species is common in chicken and pigeon houses, in rabbit hutches and guinea pig enclosures, and even in goat or sheep corrals. In sylvatic conditions, Triatoma infestans occurs in interstices of stone walls or among rocks, in hollow trees or under bark, under rocks on the ground or under trunks of fallen trees. Triatoma infestans also has been collected in shelters, burrows or nests of various animals, such as marsupials (didelphids), rodents (Microcavia australis, Graomys sp., Galea musteloides leucoblephara [Bunneister]) or birds (owls); it also inhabits birds nests abandoned by its original inhabitants and occupied by small mammals. It should be stressed, however, that Triatoma infestans is now mainly domestic, and that the finding of sylvatic specimens is the exception rather than the rule in this species. Triatoma infestans tolerates temperatures from below OC. to 37C.
The eggs of this species are not attached to the substrate. OBSERVATION: Triatoma inf estans can be distinguished from all other species with which it could possibly be confused, by the color pattern of its legs.

C.; of occulta, Zoologisches Museum, Berlin; of fioridana, California Acad emy of Sciences. DISTRIBUTION: USA (Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, New Mexico, North Car olina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Caroli na, Tennessee, Texas); Mexico (Nuevo Leon). BIOLOGY: This species has been found natu rally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. Pack chanian (1940) collected specimens in human habitations; nymphs were encountered under bolsters and in beds, as well as in crack in wood or behind wall paper. Sylvatic specimens occur in nests of Neotoma micropus Baird, and have also been found in a resting place occu pied by a squirrel, probably Spermophilus vari agatus (Erxleben). OBSERVATIONS: Stal (1859) described this species as Conorhinus lecticularius, based upon specimens from Carolina and India orien talis, the former specimen belonging to the Stockholm Museum, the latter to the Berlin Museum. In 1872, Stal synonymized his lecticularius with variegatus, a synonym of rubrofasciata. Neiva (1914a) placed lecticularius in the synonymy of sanguisuga, stating that he had seen the type of lecticularius in the Stockholm Museum. The supposed syntype of lecticularius at the Stockholm Museum was examined by the first author of this paper; it bears labels indicating Texas; Belfrage as collecting data. Texas is not mentioned as a locality in the original descrption of the species; therefore, this specimen cannot be a syntype of lecticularius, but it may well be a syntype of heidemanni Neiva, a synonym of lecticularius which was indeed de scribed from a specimen labeled Belfrage, Texas, as well as from other localities. Nowell (1975) has called attention to the fact that Belfrage is a collectors name and not a Texas locality. No lectotype has been designated for lec ticularius; this is herewith done for the syntype kept in the Berlin Museum and which we have now examined. The specimen bears a yellow label with the handwritten inscription Ind. or. and Ill, which we assume stands for the entomologist Illiger. The insect bears an obviously erroneous locality label because Tri atoma lecticularia does not occur in the East Indies. The specimen is figured here . Triatoma lecticularia is variable in size and in the shape and extension of its light markings which vary from light yellow over orange to red. The smallest specimens are found in south ern Texas and in New Mexico; their second antennal segment is less than three times as long as the first (1:2.5-2.7). Large specimens, predominant in the rest of the range of the species, have their second antennal segment over three times as long as the first (1:3.1-3.7). Usinger (1944) treated the small specimens from Texas as a subspecies, T lecticularius occulta; but we have seen enough specimens intermediate in size and in antennal measure ments to make even subspecific distinction un tenable. Usinger (Zoe. cit.) also described a new subspecies, lecticularius floridana, based on a single specimen with unusually widely extended light pronatal markings and eyes wider than half the synthlipsis. We have seen an additional Florida specimen with large eyes, but its pronotum is more extensively darkened than in the specimen figured by Usinger. Additional specimens are needed to decide on the taxonomic status of these Florida specimens; at this time the subspecies floridana is syn onymized with lecticularia.

TYPES: Of lenti, pessoai, and bahiensis, In stituto Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro. DISTRIBUTION: Brazil (Bahia). BIOLOGY: This species has been found in houses, in goat corrals and in hiding places of animals between rocks. 0BSERV A TIONS: Triatoma lenti was pub lished simultaneously with T pessoai and T
bahiensis, all from a geographically restricted area in the state of Bahia. T bahiensis was later relegated to a variety of pessoai by its authors. We have before us material of all three nominal species, and have been unable to find any morphological or mensural characters, in cluding the male genitalia, that would allow a specific separation. The only difference found is in the size of the light areas of the connex ivum, larger in pessoai than in lenti ; the color differences adduced in the original descriptions do not hold, because in specimens of pessoai the spots are either yellow as in lenti, or tum reddish. The degree of variation found in the size of the light colored spots is well within the limits com monly accepted with species of Triatoma, and until evidence to the contrary becomes avail able, we prefer to list pessoai (and bahiensis) as synonyms of lenti. The latter name is chosen as the valid one because of page priority.

Light color of connexivum shortly invading urostemites, especially on area of spiracles. TYPE: Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Ja neiro. DISTRIBUTION: Argentina (C6rdoba). BIOLOGY: This species is found under rocks on the ground, and is believed to feed on wild rodents. OBSERVATIONS: Triatoma limai is obviously closely related to Triatoma circummaculata, from which, however, it is separated by a con siderable geographical gap and slight but con stant structural and chromatic characters.
Triatoma limai is slightly larger and has some what larger eyes than circum maculata . The posterior portion of the head of limai is somewhat higher than in circummaculata , an admittedly slight but surprisingly constant character. The submedian carinae of the posterior lobe of the pronotum are distinctly longer in limai than in circummaculata where they are unusually short. The color difference (light- colored areas yellow versus red) are constant, as are the comparatively wide dark transversal bands on the connexivum of circummaculata. No intermediate forms have been found in nature, and no laboratory crossings between the two populations have been attempted. Until evidence to the contrary becomes available, we maintain separate specific status for circummaculata and limai.

DISTRIBUTION: Mexico (Aguascalientes, Chihuahua, Colima, Jalisco, Nayarit, Sinaloa, Zacatecas).
BIOLOGY: Triatoma longipennis has been found naturally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. The species (as T phyllosoma intermedia) has been reported to be domestic and peridomestic in Zacatecas. A specimen from Sinaloa now examined bears a label suggesting association with bats in a cave. OBSERVATIONS: In 1939, Usinger described Triatoma /ongipennis , differentiating it from T phyllosoma, among other char acters, by the short setae of its corium and pronotum, its longer hemelytra and the differ ent pilosity of its under surface. The long fine semierect hairs so characteristic of phyllosoma and the other species of the group are restricted in longipennis to the mesostemum; the meta stemum and abdominal venter have short de curved hairs. In 1943, Mazzotti described Triatoma phyl losoma usingeri, paratypes of which we have seen. Mazzottis subspecies possesses, according to the author, two color forms, one with the corium extensively yellowish white, the other one with the corium largely dark, marked with light basally and subapically. The holotype belongs to the form with a light-colored corium; this form agrees with our definition of pallidipennis, and we have synonymized it with that species. The dark-colored form of usingeri is very similar to longipennis, but there are long hairs not only on the meso- and metastemum but also on the abdominal venter, although not as long as those of phyllosoma. On the other hand, one of the three original longipennis examined has long hairs also on the metastemum although they are admittedly more scarce than on the mesostemum.
Usinger (1944) reduced his longipennis to subspecific rank, as T phyllosoma longipennis, again defined, among other characters, by the unusually short hairs on the metastemum and abdominal venter. In the same paper, Usinger distinguished T phyllosoma picturata from T longipennis by the long setae of the entire under surface of the body. Still in the same pa per, Usinger introduced T phyllosoma intermedia, comparing it to T phyllosoma pic turata but not to longipennis which it resembles closely. Triatoma phyllosoma intermedia has long hairs on the entire under surface of the body, and the setae of the corium are longer (0.2 mm) than in longipennis and usingeri (O.l mm), which also applies to the hairs of the pronotum (0.2-0.3 mm, versus 0.1 mm). The differences of pilosity narrated here are not sufficient to warrant formal taxonomic rank for their bearers, and we therefore list the names already in existence under longipennis, as the oldest available name. However, inten sive collecting over the entire area of the com plex and rigorously planned and executed rearing and crossing experiments are necessary to provide the definitive answer regarding the taxonomic rank of the components of the group. We do not ignore the rearing experi ments carried out by Mazzotti (1943) but con sider them as inconclusive.

TYPE: Zoologisches Museum, Berlin DISTRIBUTION: Brazil (Roraima); Colombia; Guyana; Netherlands Antilles (Aruba, Bonaire, Cura9ao); Surinam; Venezuela. Records of this species from northeastern and central Brazil refer to the closely related Triatoma pseudomaculata; T maculata does not occur south of the Amazons. BIOLOGY: Triatoma maculata is commonly found infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, and, being sometimes domestic, is a vector of Cha gas disease, the second in importance in Vene zuela. The species occurs peridomestically in chicken houses, pigeon coops, and corrals and has been collected under stones near cattle wa tering holes. Triatoma maculata also has been collected in birds nests, such as those of Pha cellodomus rufifrons inornatus Ridgway, in company with the triatomine Psammolestes arthuri. 0BSERVA TIONS: This species is highly variable in size, intensity of pigment and color pattern. At least some of this variation is geographic as shown by the ample material before us and as demonstrated by Cobben and Wygodzinsky (1975) who found constant size and color differences between populations from different islands in the Netherlands Antilles. The species is extremely similar to Triatoma pseudomaculata which has only recently been segregated from it and from which it cannot easily be distinguished on external characters alone; only the striking structural differences of the endosomal processes of the phallus allow secure identification .

TYPES: Of migrans, Deutsches Ento mologisches Institut; of pallidula, British Mu seum (Natural History). DISTRIBUTION: India (Sikkim); Indonesia (Borneo, Java, Sumatra); Malaysia (Malaya, Sarawak); Philippines; Thailand. BIOLOGY: According to its label, a specimen from Sarawak was collected in rotten heart wood of felled tree. OBSERVATIONS: Triatoma pallidula Miller was tentatively synonymized with migrans by Lent (1951d). We have now examined the type of pallidula and establish here the synonymy formally. The type specimen of pallidula agrees with other migrans in most characters accepted for this species, except the unusually small size (only 20 mm) and the low intensity of pigmentation of the dark areas of the body, the latter a phenomenon not infrequent in pre served specimens of Triatominae.

BIOLOGY: Triatoma nitida has been found naturally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi.
D1scuss10N: Usinger (1944) gave the larger body size, the complex cephalic and thoracic color pattern, and the comparatively shorter fourth antennal segment as main characters to distinguish T nitida from the closely related earlier described T neotomae. It is true that total sizes (as measured independently for males and females) do not overlap, and that the Central American nitida possesses invariably a more complex color pattern on head and thorax than the southwestern North American neo tomae. The difference in the relative length of the fourth antennal segment does not hold, however. The ratio third to fourth antennal segment in specimens of neotomae (1:1 according to Usinger) varies from 1:0.85 to 1:0.95, and is uniformly close to 1:0.8 in the specimens of nitida examined. Another difference, not men tioned before, can be observed in the shape of the hind lobe of the head, clearly rounded later ally in neotomae , and only very faintly rounded and with its sides distinctly converging toward behind, in nitida . It is imaginable that the differences shown correspond only to two points on a dine and that there exist intermediate forms between these geographically so widely separated populations. The situation is complicated by the finding in Costa Rica (San Jose, Ciudad Universitaria, May 2, 1963, G. Mufioz, one male, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro) of a specimen corresponding in size (21 mm) to nitida but in most chromatic characters similar to neotomae, and with the postocular region of the head even more strongly rounded than in neotomael Additional material is clearly needed before a final deci sion on the taxonomic status of the populations involved can be made.

TYPES: Of pallidipennis: Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet, Stockholm; of usingeri, Instituto de Salubridad y Enfermedades Tropicales, Mexico. DISTRIBUTION: Mexico (Colima, Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacan, Mexico, Morelos, Nayarit, Puebla, ?Veracruz).
BIOLOGY: Triatoma pallidipennis has been found naturally infected with Trypanosoma . cruzi. The species is frequently domestic or peridomestic. In sylvatic conditions, T pal lidipennis has been found in the nests of the woodrat, Neotoma alleni Merriam and in the burrow of the armadillo Dasypus novemcinctus mexicanus Peters. OBSERVATIONS: The above description is that of specimens, the most numerous before us, which agree with the type of the species in the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet in Stockholm; the latter has been examined by one of us (Lent). The type has short adpressed setae on the thorax as well as on the corium, and so have our specimens. This characteristic is the same as that found in the holotype and other specimens of Triatoma phyllosoma usingeri Mazzotti, one paratype of which we have examined, and which fully agrees with T pal lidipennis. We thus synonymize T phyllosoma usingeri with T pallidipennis. Usinger (1944) applied the name phyllosoma pallidipennis to specimens similar to those de scribed above, but having the pronotum clothed with long black hairs (instead of short adpressed setae). We have seen such specimens which are also characterized, just as Usinger described, by the connexival segments which are only very narrowly orange posterolaterally . Other specimens we have seen now have the setae on the corium somewhat more delicate than in those described above although still short (0.3 mm), and simi lar setae on the pronotum; these specimens have large orange spots on their connexival segments . Whatever the tax onomic fate of these and other pallidipennis like forms in the future, the concept of true pallidipennis is fixed by the type and as de scribed above.

TYPE: Museo Argentino de Historia Natural. DISTRIBUTION: Argentina (Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Chubut, C6rdoba, Corrientes, Entre Rios, La Pampa, La Rioja, Mendoza, Neu quen, Rio Negro, Salta, San Juan, San Luis, Santa Fe). BIOLOGY: Triatoma patagonica has been found naturally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. This triatomine, easily attracted by artificial light, occurs in human habitations but has not yet been reported to colonize there. It has also been found in peridomestic situations, such as in chicken houses and rabbit coops. In the wild, the species has been found under tree bark, among and under rocks on the ground, and in burrows of Microcavia australis and Graomys sp. This is an aggressive species, not only inside human habitations, but it also has been reported to attack humans sleeping on the ground in the desert. The eggs of T patagonica do not adhere to the substrate. 0BSERV A TIONS: Triatoma patagonica is highly variable regarding the distribution of the pattern elements on the corium and connex ivum; the dark pattern elements seem to be more extensive and intensive in the eastern, more humid portion of its range, and become more reduced in the semiarid western portion of Argentina. Light-colored specimens with reduced connexival spots superficially resemble T guasayana and T sordida but can easily be distinguished from the latter by their dark legs.

BIOLOGY: The species has been found natu rally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. T pen ninsularis has been collected at light, and obtained from nests of Neotoma lepida mo lagrandis Huey and N. lepida arenacea J. A. Allen. 0BSERV A TIO NS: Triatoma peninsularis as well as the very closely related sinaloensis dif fer from T protracta mainly by the absence of a transverse arcuate furrow behind the base of the clypeus and the uniform outline of the dor sal surface of the head when observed laterally; peninsularis is also smaller than any form of protracta. Ryckman (1962) crossed T penin sularis with all forms of T protracta and ob tained only sterile eggs, embryos or weak F1 nymphs that died in the first or second instar; the results of these experiments confirm the specific status of peninsularis.

DISTRIBUTION: Brazil (Bahia, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte). BIOLOGY: This species occurs in xeric hab itats; it has been found in burrows of moc6s, Kerodon rupestris. DISCUSSION: Triatoma petrochii is super ficially similar to T brasiliensis to which it is possibly closely related. In addition to its very long head, T petrochii differs from brasiliensis by such characters as the relatively very short first antennal segment, the practically glabrous rostrum, and the absence of spongy fossulae in males as well as in females. The two species, which have been found sympatrically, are mu tually sterile.

In addition to Oaxaca, the literature contains references to phyllosoma from Chiapas, Durango, Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacan, Nayarit, Sinaloa, and Zacatecas. Many of these references (e.g., Mazzotti, 1962) obviously refer to the phyl losoma complex, and are not pertinent to the establishment of the area of phyllosoma sensu stricto. Usinger (1944) and Usinger, Wygodzinsky and Ryckman (1966) imply that the species (as typical phyllosoma) is restricted to Oaxaca, from where it was also described. Usinger (1944) considered it as rare, and in our own research we have not seen specimens from any state but Oaxaca. BIOLOGY: This species has been found natu rally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. It has been captured in human habitations and per idomestically (in chicken and pigeon coops, in pig sties and sheep stables).
0BSERV A TIO NS: Triatoma phyllosoma is one of the members of a group of several closely related species of Triatoma, all of which occur in Western Mexico. The first representatives of the group were placed by Stal in a separate genus, Meccus Stal. The following specific or subspecific names have been applied to the phyllosoma group, listed here in chronological order: phyllosoma Burmeister, 1835 pallidipennis Stal, 1872 picturata Usinger, 1939 longipennis Usinger, 1939 mazzottii U singer, 1941 usingeri Mazzotti, 1943 intermedia Usinger, 1944 Until 1941, the then-named forms were dealt with as separate species. Mazzotti and Osorio (1941), Mazzotti (l943a) and mainly Usinger (1944) reduced these names to subspecific rank with phyllosoma being the nominal subspecies; Usinger, Wygodzinsky and Ryckman (1966) followed the same procedure. Usinger (1944) stated that he was basing his concept of the phyllosoma group as an assemblage of subspecies within a single species complex on laboratory work by Mazzotti and Osorio (1942) who crossed several of the forms in this group and concluded that they thus represent subspecies within a single species concept. Usinger (Loe. cit.) said further that Mazzottis experimental work is the foundation upon which the entire treatment of the group is based. Usinger, Wygodzinsky and Ryckman (1966) considered the complex as being a polytypic species of the type with abrupt steps rather than gradual morphological differences, a statement that does not reinforce the hypothe sis of subspecific status for the components of the complex. Interfertility between populations under laboratory conditions [another argument adduced by Mazzotti and Osorio (1942) and Usinger, Wygodzinsky and Ryckman (1966) for the subspecific status of the components of the group] is not a valid indicator of taxonomic rank, although intersterility would strongly sug gest specific rank of the putative parents. Fur thermore, a careful analysis of Mazzotti and Osorios (1942) paper shows incongruencies which, at least in our eyes, greatly diminish the value of their studies. The design of the experi ments as well as the interpretations of the resuits are vastly inferior to such exhaustive procedures and careful analysis as those em ployed in an exemplary way by Ryckman (1962) for the Triatoma protracta group. A similarly careful analysis of the phyllosoma group, combined with intensive collecting over the entire range of the complex, are required before a definitive taxonomic treatment of these insects can be attempted with a reasonable chance of success. We do not doubt that the members of the phyllosoma complex share a recent common ancestor not shared by any other species, and thus constitute a monophyletic group. However, until acceptable distributional and ge netical evidence to the contrary becomes avail able we will treat the taxonomically distinct components of the group as species. The phyllosoma group contains seven named forms as listed above; we now synonymize in termedia and usingeri with longipennis, be cause their differences from longipennis are minor as compared with those normally ac cepted for indicating specific rank in the Tri atominae. As Usinger (1944) stated, phyllosoma and mazzottii are closely related, as are picturata and longipennis, with pallidipennis being inter mediate in setal characters. Triatoma phyllosoma differs from the other species of its group by the combination of long hairs on the entire body, the brachypterous con dition in both sexes, and the overall black color with relatively small red spots on corium and connexivum. The characteristic lateral endo soma processes of the male genitalia are very similar in all species of the phyllosoma group.

DISTRIBUTION: Argentina (Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Chaco, C6rdoba, Corrientes, Entre Rfos, Formosa, Jujuy, La Pampa, La Rioja, Mendoza, Rfo Negro, San Juan, San Luis, Santa Fe, Santiago del Estero, Salta, Tucuman); southern Bolivia; southern Para guay. BIOLOOY: Triatoma platensis has been found naturally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. Al though occasionally occuring in peridomestic situations, such as in primitively constructed chicken houses or in goat corrals, the species lives mainly in birds nests, such as those of Pseudoseisura lophotes (Reichenback) (Fur nariidae), rarely in nests of Myiopsitta monacha cotorra, and other, nonidentified species. In some cases, the nests had been abandoned and taken over by marsupials (Lutreolina crassacauda paranalis Thomas) or rodents (Phyllotes cachinus J. A. Allen). Triatoma platensis has also been found in nests of Micro cavia australis. The species may occur together with other triatomines, such as Triatoma in festans, T sordida, or Psammolestes coreodes. The eggs of T platensis are glued to the substrate, isolated or in small, irregular groups. With this species occurring mainly in birds nests, the fixing of the eggs to the substrate prevents them from falling to the ground. Occasional hybrids between Triatoma platensis and Triatoma irifestans have been found in nature.

TYPES: Of protractus, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. of woodi, navajoensis, zacatecen sis and nahuatlae, California Academy of Sciences. DISTRIBUTION: USA (Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas and Utah); Mexico (Baja California Norte, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Durango, Nuevo Leon, San Luis Potosi, Sinaloa, Sonora, Tamulipas, and Zacatecas). BIOLOGY: T protracta has been found natu rally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. Speci mens have been caught in domiciles, even in beds, but the species does not colonize in human habitations. The natural hosts of T pro tracta are woodrats of the genus Neotoma; the bugs have been collected from the lodges of the following: Neotoma albigula albigula; N. a. leucodon Merriam; N. fuscipes annectens Elliot; N. f. fuscipes Baird; N. f. macrotis Thomas; N. f. martirensis Orr; N. f. simplex True; N. lepida egressa Orr; N. I. grinelli Hall; N. I. lepida Thomas; N. I. molagrandis; N. micropus canescens, and N. m. micropus. OBSERVATIONS: Triatoma protracta is an ex ceedingly polymorphic species; Ryckman (1962) divided it into five subspecies. Ryckmans paper is based on very extensive rearing and hybridizing experiments, and is the most painstaking work on experimental triatomine systematics, which should be consulted by any one interested in the problem of species and infraspecific taxa in this group. Although specimens of protracta can usually be placed in one or the other of the subspecies adopted by Ryck man, intermediates between the named subspecies are found, one subspecies (woodi) is admittedly polymorphic, and in others, such as p. zacatecensis and p. nahuatlae, the apparent differences are extremely slight. A good sum mary of the genetic relationships of the forms of protracta (and of the closely related T bar beri, T peninsularis and P. sinaloensis) was given by Usinger, Ryckman and Wygodzinsky (1966). The typical form of protracta is widely distributed in the south western USA (Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah) and northern Mexico (Baja Califor nia Norte, Sonora). The overall color of this form is dark brown or black, and the size varies in the male from 14 to 19.5 mm and in the female from 14 to 20.5 mm Last instar nymphs are generally dark. Triatoma protracta navajoensis occurs only on the high Colorado Plateau (Arizona, Colo rado, New Mexico, and Utah). This form is very similar to the nominal one. Its color varies from dark brown to black, but it is larger than p. protracta: the males vary from 20 to 21 mm, and the females from 20.5 to 23 mm The fifth instar nymphs are very light colored. Triatoma protracta woodi is largely restricted to the Rio Grande River drainage system (USA: Arizona, Texas and New Mexico; Mexico: Coahuila, Chihuahua, Nuevo Le6n, Tamaulipas). Speci mens of woodi are from dark to light brown in color; some have a large dark spot on the cor ium and many, but by no means all, have the connexivum contrastingly lighter than the rest of the abdomen. This form is smaller than p. protracta: males range from 13 to 16.5 mm, females from 14 to 17 mm The nymphs are brownish. Triatoma protracta zacatecensis inhabits the central Mexican plateau (Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Nuevo Le6n, San Luis Potosi, Zacatecas). This form is dark brown or black except for the contrastingly light-colored mem brane and some light areas on the corium. The size of the male ranges from 13 .1 to 15. 3 mm , of the female from 13.5 to 16.2 mm The color of the nymph varies from light to dark brown. Triatoma protracta nahuatlae has only been reported from the lowlands of the Pacific coast states of Sonora and Sinaloa. This is the small est member of the group, with males ranging from 12.5 to 14.5 mm, and the females from 13.0-14.8 mm T p. nahuatlae seems close to zacatecensis, and although some specimens do have a dark membrane, others are lighter and tend toward the condition in zacatecensis. The nymph of nahuatlae is dark. The eggs of T protracta normally have a rough surface, except in the populations from southwestern California and northwestern Baja California where the eggs are smooth and glossy.

DISTRIBUTION: Brazil (Alagoas, Bahia, Brasilia, D. F., Ceara, Goias, Minas Gerais, Parafba, Pernambuco, Piauf, Rio Grande do Norte). BIOLOGY: Triatoma pseudomaculata has been found naturally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi, and has been collected peridomestically and in human habitations. In most cases, this species occurs in low numbers as compared to other domestic species in northeastern Brazil, and is not considered an important vector of Chagas disease. OBSERVATIONS: Triatoma pseudomaculata and T maculata are very similar and cannot in all cases be distinguished by their color pattern. The number and extension of spots on the hind lobe of the pronotum is extremely variable in either species, and so is the number and exten sion of the yellow or red spots on the propleura and mesopleura. Most pseudomaculata are darker than maculata, but some are not. The head is somewhat higher posteriorly in mac ulata than it is in pseudomaculata, and the eyes of the latter species seem to be comparatively smaller . The ros trum furnishes good characters as shown in our keys and figures 1058 and 1508; these char acters seem to be constant. By far the best differential character is found in the structure of the apex of the lateral endosoma processes of the phallus of the male, first clearly pointed out by Galvao (1973): the apex of the endosoma process of maculata is coarsely ridged longitudinally, but delicately striate and beset with denticles apically in pseudomaculata . The two species are vicariants geo graphically, with maculata occupying the northern and pseudomaculata the southern portion of the range. The fact that pseudomaculata and maculata are good species is confirmed by their partial sterility when crossed in the labora tory (Correa and Espinola, 1964).

TYPES: Of recurvus, Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet, Stockholm; of longipes and of nigricollis, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington. DISTRIBUTION: Mexico (Chihuahua, Nayarit, Sinaloa, Sonora); USA (Arizona). BIOLOGY: This species has been reported as being naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. In the laboratory, the species will feed on lizards and snakes. Triatoma recurva is not normally found associated with species of Neotoma as are so many other species of triatomines in the American Southwest and in Mexico, but it does occur in nests of another rodent, Citellus variegatus grammurus (Say). The species is attracted by light. OBSERVATIONS: Usinger (1944) described a subspecies longipes nigricollis from Nayarit, based upon a single specimen, which, according to the author, differs from typical recurva by the somewhat wider extension of the yellow portion of the connexivum, the slightly larger eyes, and the almost black overall color. We have observed that the overall color of preserved specimens varies in intensity according to the state of preservation of the specimens from dark brown to black. Although there is a tendency toward an extension of the yellow areas of the connexivum in Mexican specimens, similarly extended light areas are found in occasional specimens from Arizona. The eye measurements of nigricollis fall within the range of such measurements in specimens from Arizona. We conclude that nigricollis should not be maintained as a valid name.

TYPES: Of rubida, uhleri, and ocellata, Na tional Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington; of mexicana, British Museum (Natural History); of sonoriana, British Museum (Natural History); of jaegeri and cochimiensis, unknown. DISTRIBUTION: USA (Arizona, California, New Mexico, Texas); Mexico (Baja California, Nayarit, Sinaloa, Sonora, Vera Cruz). The spe cies had been known in Mexico only from states on the West Coast; we have now exam ined a female from the east coast: Mexico: Veracruz: Citlaltepetl, 3000 [ft.?], Aug. 3, 1964, Swan col. (CAS). BIOLOGY: Triatoma rubida has been found infected naturally by T cruzi. The species has been collected from nests of woodrats (N eo toma albigula albigula and N. lepida Thomas), and has been reported feeding on the fish-eating bat Pizonyx vivesi (Menegaux). OBSERVATIONS: This species varies consid erably in size and in the distribution and inten sity of its pattern elements. Usinger (1944) and Ryckman (1967) recognized three respectively five subspecies. Ryckman (Loe. cit.) gave a tabular key to the subspecies. The characters used by these authors are the tonality of light colored markings as well as their absence, pres ence and extension on the different parts of the body, and the extension of the dark and light connexival markings. In typical rubida the connexival margin is entirely light colored, but in sonoriana and jaegeri dark connexival markings attain the outer connexival margins, and the pronotum and corium are uniformly dark in jaegeri . The light markings are red in rubida and the humeral angles are dark except their mar gins; the light-colored markings of uhleri and cochimiensis are yellow respectively light brown or orange. The nominate form of rubida seems to be restricted to the Cape region of Baja California, cochimiensis is found in cen tral Baja California, jaegeri has only been reported from one small island in the central Gulf of Lower California, sonoriana occurs in the Mexican states of Sonora, Sinaloa, and Nayarit, whereas uhleri is found in the Ameri can Southwest and in the Mexican state of Veracruz. Although specimens seem to cluster around the phenotypes mentioned, not all fall easily into the categories listed above; there does seem to be a prevalence of comparatively light colored, large-sized forms in the north and of smaller, more intensely pigmented forms in the southern part of the total range of the species. Much more abundant material than that exam ined by us, especially from Mexico, combined with rearing experiments, is needed for an understanding of the biosystematics of Triatoma rubida. Triatoma rubida can be distinguished from other North American species by its relatively long first antennal segment which attains, or projects beyond, the apex of the clypeus. This character is also found in Triatoma rubrofasciata, which is superficially similar to rubida, but the former species is conspicuously granulose on the head and pronotum, and rubida is not.

AUSTRALIAN REGION AND PACIFIC: Caroline Islands; Hawaii; New Guinea. This is the only tropicopolitan species of the genus. It is most frequently encountered in port cities, although in some countries, such as India and Brazil, it has been found hundreds of kilometers inland. BIOLOGY: Triatoma rubrofasciata, even though in many cases found naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi and entering and colo nizing human habitations in many parts of the world, is not commonly an active vector of Chagas disease. Trypanosoma cruzi, of course, is not found in the Old World, but even in the Americas T rubrofasciata, exclusively domestic here, has been shown to be a vector of Chagas disease only in three cases. On the other hand, T rubrofasciata frequently harbors another species of Trypanosoma, conorhini, a species limited to triatomines as vectors and Rattus rattus (L.) as its vertebrate host. On some occasions, T rubrofasciata has been found in pigeon coops. 0BSERV A TIO NS: This wide-ranging species is easily distinguished from all others of the genus by the combination of the elongate first anten nal segment, the conspicuous granules of the head and thorax, and the characteristic color pattern, especially the light-colored margin of the pronotum. There is some individual varia tion in the extension of the reddish markings in this species, but the light-colored sides of the pronotum are always distinctly perceptible. We have examined a lot of melanic specimens of T rubrofasciata obtained from a lizard cage at the Honolulu Zoo, which to the unaided eye appear entirely black except the faintly per ceptible reddish markings of the connexivum . No normally colored individuals were found among this lot composed of about IO adults and numerous nymphs; the latter also appeared entirely black, whereas normal nymphs of the species are reddish.

TYPES: Of rubrovarius, unknown; of rubroniger, Zoologisches Museum, Berlin; of gomesi, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz; of bruchi, Misi6n de Estudios de Patologia Regional Ar gentina, Buenos Aires. DISTRIBUTION: Argentina (C6rdoba, Cor rientes, Entre Rios, Misiones); Brazil (Parana, Rio Grande do Sul); Uruguay. There are litera ture references for this species from Java, Chile, and the Brazilian state of Bahia. We consider these references as spurious, because they do not fit the established geographic pattern of rubrovaria, and have not been con firmed by additional findings. BIOLOGY: Triatoma rubrovaria has been found naturally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. The species occurs only very rarely in human habitations where it does not colonize. Tri atoma rubrovaria is a sylvatic species with ap parent preference for rocky habitats (stonewalls, corrals, land covered with stones) where it lives in the interstices between stones and under rocks. This niche also serves lizards, geckos, and amphibians which provide blood meals for the triatomines. In the laboratory, T rubrovaria will feed on birds or mammals, as is also suggested by a find of this species in a burrow of the armadillo Dasypus hybridus (Desmarest). Under laboratory conditions, T rubrovaria has readily fed on mygalomorph spiders and even attacked silkworms. The eggs of this species are not attached to the substrate.
0BSERV A TIONS: Carcavallo et al. ( 1967) stated that the type of Triatoma bruchi appears to be a natural hybrid between T rubrovaria and T infestans. Carcavallo and Martinez (1968) repeated this opinion. The first author of the present paper re-examined the type and did not find it to differ from specimens of true T rubrovaria characterized by an entirely black pronotum. A comparison of the single specimen of T bruchi with actual hybrids between T infestans and T rubrovaria obtained in the laboratory by the second author of this paper also showed that they are not identical. For these reasons, T bruchi is here synonymized with T rubrovaria. We have now examined three specimens of rubroniger belonging to the Berlin Museum, constituting the type series, and all numbered as 2927. We selected as lectotype a female, the only specimen bearing an obviously old, hand written collectors label (Sello, or Sellow) and an equally old handwritten determination label, probably in StAls handwriting (rubroniger StAI). The remaining two specimens, a male and a female, bear handwritten number labels and comparatively recent locality and deter mination labels. The pronotum of the lectotype is almost en tirely black, but 1 + 1 very small reddish spots are visible in the humeral area. Various authors have illustrated some of the chromatic variations of the pronotum and cor ium of the species; a few of the variations of the pronotum are shown here again . Lent (1942) has proved that these variations are individual and not geographic.

We have seen an additional female from Honduras, intercepted in an airplane in Miami, Florida, and two females intercepted in Miami in bromeliads proceeding from Guatemala. BIOLOGY: Unknown; possibly arboreal.
D1scuss10N: This is a taxonomically isolated species. The 1 + 1 anterior projections of the scutellum, quite characteristic of T ryckmani, are similar to those found in the Cuban Tri atoma flavida and the Argentinean T platensis, but we have not found any other character that would imply close relationship between T ryckmani and the other species mentioned. The Honduran and Guatemalan specimens agree entirely except for the somewhat darker and more extensive connexival markings of the Guatemalan specimens .

TYPES: Of sanguisuga, unknown; of later alis, Zoologisches Museum, Berlin; of am bigua, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.; of pintoi, unknown; of texana, California Acad emy of Sciences. DISTRIBUTION: USA (Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Ten nessee, Texas, Virginia). BIOLOGY: T sanguisuga has been found in fected with Trypanosoma cruzi, and, together with the opossum, is an important reservoir of Chagas disease. This triatomine has also been reported infected with equine encephalitis virus. Triatoma sanguisuga is frequently found in human habitations, even in urban situations, but it does not colonize in houses; Walsh and Riley (1869) were the first to report the species in habitations. Triatoma sanguisuga will feed on humans, a fact known since its original description. First instar nymphs have been reported to attack frequently other insects and suck their hemolymph, a behavior pattern also observed in some other Triatominae. Per idomestic T sanguisuga have been collected in chicken coops, dog houses, stables, and corrals where they attack horses and other animals. The species occurs in sylvatic habitats such as hollow trees inhabited by various invertebrates and vertebrates, e.g., raccoons and opossums, under logs and at the base of palmetto fronds coexisting with Hyla sp. The bugs are frequently found in or near woodrat nests (Neotoma fioridana [Ord], baylei Merriam, micropus Baird) and those of cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus texicanus [Audubon and Bachman]). The bugs are attracted to artificial light. 0BSERV A TIONS: This species is quite variable as regards size and chromatic distribution. Over most of its range, T sanguisuga specimens attain or surpass 20 mm in length, but in the extreme south of Texas and in the southern two-thirds of Florida specimens are much smaller (16-19 mm). In the small Texas specimens the light connexival markings seem to be smaller than in most specimens of the typical form, but in specimens from southern Florida they tend to be larger. The eyes are approximately half as long as the dorsal interocular distance over most of the range of the species, including southern Texas, but in southern Florida specimens the eyes tend to be wider than half the width of the dorsal interocular distance. Finally, the light-colored areas of the connexivum are mostly reddish and only rarely yellow in the typical form, but yel lowish in most although not all specimens from southern Texas and southern Florida. Usinger (1944) recognized the southern Texas form (tex ana) and the Florida form (ambigua) as subspecies of sanguisuga, but the distinguishing characters used are minor and the populations are not separated by a distinctive gap geograph ically or in characters. Mead (1965) stated that there is an intergrading zone in the Gainesville area of Florida and that much of north-central Florida yields intermediate forms between san guisuga sanguisuga and sanguisuga ambigua. We agree with Mead that a long series of specimens around the state is needed for a bet ter understanding of the forms, a suggestion that may well apply to the entire sanguisuga complex. A careful statistical analysis of wild captured specimens and appropriate rearing and breeding experiments are necessary to under stand fully this species and the closely related indictiva. At this time, we do not accept the subspecies proposed. The original series of lateralis, kept in the Berlin Museum, consists of two females, three males, and one nymph, all labeled as from Georgia, and numbered 2923. We designate as lectotype the only specimen (a female) that has a printed number label, a handwritten locality label (Georgia Esch.), and an obviously old handwritten determination label (lateralis Stc\l). 

Triatoma sinaloensis Ryckman Figures 170, 171 Triatoma sinaloensis Ryckman, 1962, p. 118, pl. 2, figL.
This species is so similar to T peninsularis that a detailed redescription is not necessary. Triatoma sinaloensis is slightly smaller than peninsularis (males 10.3-11.5 mm, females 10-4-12.5 mm), the overall color is from light to dark reddish brown, and the body surface is highly polished. The slight difference in head shape may also be of taxonomic importance. TYPE: California Academy of Sciences.
DISTRIBUTION: Mexico (Sinaloa; Sonora). BIOLOGY: T sinaloensis has been found nat urally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. The species occurs in nests of the woodrats Neotoma phenax Merriam and N. albigula melanura Merriam. OBSERVATION: Ryckman (1962) has shown that crosses between T sinaloensis and T pen insularis produce either sterile eggs, or embryos only, thus proving that they are two different species, even though very close phenotypically.

TYPES: Of sordida, Zoologisches Museum, Berlin; of garciabesi, Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales, Buenos Aires. DISTRIBUTION: Argentina (Buenos Aires, Chaco, C6rdoba, Corrientes, Formosa, Jujuy, La Rioja, Misiones, Salta, Santa Fe, Santiago del Estero, Tucuman); Bolivia; Brazil (Bahia, Goias, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Parana, Pemambuco, Piauf, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Sao Paulo); Paraguay; Uruguay. The only record of this species from Chile has not been confirmed by additional findings, and is doubtful. BIOLOGY: This species is frequently found naturally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. Tri atoma sordida colonizes in human habitations, and is an important vector of Chagas disease in certain areas. The invasion of human habita tions is facilitated by the frequently peridomes tic condition of T sordida which colonizes in chicken and pigeon houses, has been found in sparrows nests, and is known to occur in rats nests and in places where domestic guinea pigs and rabbits are kept. Triatoma sordida has been collected from nests of wild birds, such as Phacellodomus rufifrons rufifrons (Wied), Ph. rufifrons sincipitalis cabanis, Anumbius an numbi (Vieillot), Heleodytes unicolor (Lafresnaye), Myopsitta monacha cotorra, and Pseudoseisura lophotes. Triatoma sordida has been found in hollow trees, among exposed tree roots, and under loose bark of trees and fence posts; it occurs in the crown of palm trees, in clumps of agaves and bromeliads, in clumps of herbaceous vegetation, and in stone walls. There are references indicating that this species prefers the vicinity of water courses. The eggs of T sordida are laid loose. OBSERVATIONS: Specimens from the semi arid areas of northwestern Argentina tend to be smaller and, in many cases although not invar iably, darker than most individuals of this spe cies. Abalos and Wygodzinsky (1951), after examining large numbers of specimens from the entire range of the species, could not find constant characters to distinguish unequivocally the Argentinian population mentioned from other sordida. Carcavallo et al. (1967) de scribed these small bugs as a separate species, garciabesi. Upon comparison of paratypes of garciabesi with specimens of sordida from outside the range of garciabesi , we found that none of the chro matic and morphological characters considered as diagnostic by Carcavallo et al. (Loe. cit.) and Carcavallo and Martinez (1968) is either con stant or serves to distinguish garciabesi from all specimens of sordida examined. We con clude that, in the absence of experimental work, garciabesi cannot be maintained as a separate species.

TYPES: Of spinolai, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro; of chilena, The American Mu seum of Natural History; of porteri, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro. DISTRIBUTION: Chile (between 18S and 34S). BIOLOGY: Triatoma spinolai has been found naturally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. The species is restricted to the semiarid and arid regions of Chile. It has been collected among stones and in rock crevices, as well as in resting places of the wolf Dusicyon sp., rabbits and hares, vizcachas (J,agidium sp.), and other rodents. Triatoma spinolai has also been en countered associated with marsupials (Marmosa sp.) and in corrals of domestic animals. In the area of coastal cliffs various guano birds are attacked-the bugs bite the birds legs and feet. Fisherman and shell gatherers are also attacked at the seashore. The species has been found to attack man, mammals, and birds also in inland localities, in plain daylight. Triatoma spinolai has been found in human habitations but does not colonize there. In the laboratory, this species could not be maintained for more than two generations when fed on pigeons. 0BSERVA noNs: This is the only conspicuously polymorphic species of triatomines, with macropterous, brachypterous, or micropterous males and invariably micropterous females. The genetics of this situation has not been worked out, and would constitute a fascinating subject, combined with mapping-geographically and ecologically-the occurrence of the various morphs. Two generic names, Mepraia and Tri atomaptera, have almost simultaneously been proposed for Triatoma spinolai, both because of the extreme alary polymorphism in this spe cies, unique in the subfamily Triatominae. Alary polymorphism is a quite common occurrence in other reduviid subfamilies (Reduviinae, Ectrichodiinae, Emesinae, and others); it ap pears in many genera independently, frequently although not exclusively in deserticolous spe cies. Alary polymorphism is of limited sys tematic value because at least in the subfamilies mentioned above it occurs in species closely related to fully macropterous, clearly con generic species. Another unusual autapomorphic character of T spinolai, on the specific level, is the special ized connexivum with a large membranous area separating the ventral connexival plates from the urosternites in the female but not in the male . The presence of ciliate setae on the second antennal segment of the male but not of the female is equally of interest. Sensory setae on the tarsal segments of the adult are more numerous in this species than in other Tri atoma.

DISTRIBUTION: Brazil (Bahia, Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais, Parana, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Santa Catarina, Sergipe). BIOLOGY: This widespread species has been found naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. It has been collected in epiphytic bro meliads, near or in the nests of the marsupials Didelphis azarae azarea Temminck and Mar mosa cinerea paraguayana Thomas, as well as of Oryzomys sp. and of spiny rats (Echi myidae). Miles (1975) suggested that the color ation in this species is a camouflage for the bugs occurrence at the dry junction of epi phytes and trees.

TYPE SPECIES: Eratyrus mucronatus Stal. DISTRIBUTION: Central America and South America south of Bolivia.
BIOLOGY: Occasionally in houses or per idomestic, otherwise associated with bats. OBSERVATIONS: Eratyrus differs from Tri atoma by the characters given in the keys and furthermore by the unusually long antennae which in Triatoma fall short of the apex of the scutellum when bent backward. The two species included in the genus are very similar and not easily to be determined specifically in all cases. However, the shape of the free portion of the vesica is constantly dif ferent, and serves to identify securely at least the males. The ranges of the two species are different: E. cuspidatus occurs in Central America and in South America west of the Andes, while E. mucronatus is found in the vast continental reaches east of the Andean chain. However, the species may be sympatric in some areas of western and northern V ene zuela.

Apex of first rostral segment falling dis tinctly short of level of apex of antenniferous tubercle; second segment not attaining level of anterior margin of eyes; third segment extending close to but not attaining level of hind margin of eyes. Ratio of rostral segments 1:2.25:0.60.
Pronotum black, its sides not carinate. Anterior lobe not strongly elevated, ridges granulose. Posterior lobe rugose, granulose, with submedian carinae extending back ward to slightly beyond middle of posterior lobe. Humeral angles prominent, very narrowly rounded.

Abdomen as described for L. costalis. TYPE: British Museum (Natural History). DISTRIBUTION: Distant (1904) indicated this species to be from North India; the type bears a label reading E. Ind. BIOLOGY: Unknown. 0BSERV A TIO NS: This is the largest species of Linshcosteus, known only from the female. A male in the British Museum, labeled but not published by Lent as allotype of carnif ex, and included by Ghauri (1976) with doubts in this species, is being described as a new species in this paper. Cenaeus carnifex, described as Cimex car nif ex by Fabricius, is a South African pyr rhocorid; it happens to share its specific name with the type species of Linshcosteus.
There is a poorly preserved female specimen of Linshcosteus in the collection of the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz. This specimen, illustrated by Pinto (1925; figs. 57, 58), is labeled Cawnpore, India/, P.R. Uhler Collection/Linshcosteus car nifex Stal. This is a female, 26.5 mm long, which agrees with the type of carnif ex except that its hemelytra are conspicuously shortened, leaving the seventh and following urotergites entirely exposed. Cawnpore [Kanpur] is in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh; thus, even if we do not assign the specimen defi nitely to carnif ex, it does provide evidence that Linshcosteus is not restricted to South India.

TYPE: British Museum (Natural History). DISTRIBUTION: South India; Mysore. BIOLOGY: This species was found under boulders and rocks, associated with Linshcosteus confumus. OBSERVATIONS: We have examined four par atypes which agree well with the original descrption. The color pattern alone will serve to distinguish costalis from the remaining species of the genus. Even though fully sympatric and sharing identical microhabitat, intermediate forms between costalis and confumus have not been found, confirming the specific rank of the two populations.

First instar nymph: As described for tribe; rostrum attaining prosternum, slender; third segment with paired rostral organ; stridulatory sulcus present; hind tarsi apically with long, delicate sensory hairs. TYPE SPECIES: Conorhinus maximus Uhler DISTRIBUTION: Mexico (Baja California Sur). BIOLOGY: Found among rocks, associated with lizards and possibly mammals. 0BSERV A TIONS: Dipetalogaster differs from all other triatomines by such highly apomorphic characters as its extraordinarily large size, the unique structure of the connexival margin of the abdomen and the double invagi nated flasklike organ on the third rostral segment in all instars. Dipetalogaster maximus possesses other characters which are apomorphic within the framework of the Tri atomini, viz., the tubercle-like process of the scutellum, the median longitudinal carina of the metasternum, the two conspicuously different kinds of setae on the second antennal segment of the adult and, in the fifth nymphal instar, the delicately annulate third and fourth antennal segment (only fourth segment annulate in fifth instar nymphs of most Triatominae). The ap omorphic characters mentioned in the foregoing sentence are shared with the Chilean Triatoma spinolai which inhabits the semiarid and arid coastal area of that country.

TYPE: National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C. DISTRIBUTION: Mexico (southernmost Baja California Sur). BIOLOGY: Dipetalogaster maximus has been found naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. It is a sylvatic species with only accidental occurrences in rural habitations. Specimens were found among exfoliative rocks, and their main hosts seem to be lizards (Sauromalus australis Shaw and Petrosaurus thalassinus [Cope]) but they also feed on woodrats, and probably other mammals. In the laboratory, a variety of hosts are accepted. It has been observed that the bugs will emerge from their hideouts, even around noon on very hot days, to attack people resting on the rocks. A similar phenomenon was observed in the unrelated Tri atoma spinolai inhabiting the Chilean desert. Both species have developed special although different connexival modifications permitting an extraordinary abdominal extension allowing them toingest unusually large bloodmeals, pos sibly an advantage under the harsh semiarid or arid conditions where these species occur. The potential extension of the abdomen of D. max imus is illustrated by Ryckman and Ryckman (1967a), Mazzotti (1970), Lent and Jurberg (1972), and in our figure 2108.

OBSERVATION: We have prepared a clado gram to show our concept of the cladistic relationships within the genus Pan strongylus. This scheme is based on characters of the adults. An analysis of the characters of the nymphs, not possible at this time due to lack of sufficient material, will be a test for the hypothesis visualized in the cladogram.

Be cause identification of the species of Pan strongylus is perfectly feasible without the examination of the male genitalia, the lateral endosoma processes are not figured here. A profusely illustrated study of the male and fe male genitalia of all species of Panstrongylus has been made by Lent and Jurberg (1975) and should be consulted by those wishing further information.

BIOLOGY: Panstrongylus chinai has been found naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. The species has been found to occur in chicken houses and occasionally in human habitations where a few nymphs were also collected, but it is not truly domestic. Specimens have also been attracted to ljght. The sylvatic habitat of P. chinai and its true hosts are unknown.
In Peru, P. chinai occurs in the Amazonian drainage basin as well as on the Pacific slope of the Andes, between sea level and 1500 meters.

TYPES: Of geniculatus, unknown; of lutulen tus, unknown; of corticalis, British Museum (Natural History), of tenuis and fluminensis, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro; of parageniculatus, unknown. DISTRIBUTION: Argentina (Chaco, Cor rientes, Formosa, Misiones, Santa Fe, Santiago del Estero); Bolivia; Brazil (Acre, Amapa, Am azonas, Bahia, Brasilia, D. F., Ceara, Espirito Santo, Goias, Maranhiio, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Para, Parana, Rio de Janeiro, Ron donia, Sao Paulo); Colombia; Costa Rica; Ec uador; French Guiana; Guyana; Nicaragua; Surinam; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Trinidad; Uruguay; Venezuela. This is the first record for the species from Nicaragua: EI Recreo, Blue fields, March 3, 1948 (L. E. Long; Field Mu seum of Natural History, Chicago), one male. BIOLOGY: Panstrongylus geniculatus is known to carry Trypanosoma cruzi and to transmit this protozoan among armadillos in whose burrows it frequently lives. The species has also been collected in burrows of anteaters, pacas, and of Coendou, in bat caves, under tree bark close to birds nests, and on various palm trees. The species is commonly attracted to light and can be found in human habitations but does not colonize there; it is a sylvatic species. Panstrongylus geniculatus proves difficult to rear under laboratory conditions unless 100 per cent humidity is maintained. OBSERVATIONS: This is a highly variable species as regards its size and markings. The description given above points out the chromat ic variation of the head, antennae, thorax and legs, but the most striking pattern differences are found in the number, size and distribution of the dark spots on the abdominal venter . The great majority of the specimens examined by us now ( 150) pos sess one median row of large markings, their shape varying from subsemicircular to subtriangular. This median series is absent in two specimens from Venezuela and in one specimen from Bolivia that we have exam ined. The most frequent pattern formed by the smaller spots is represented in fig221E, viz., urosternites IV-VI with 1 + 1 anterosubmedian and 1 + 1 posterolateral spots; this combination was found in 34 out of 76 specimens from Barro Colorado Island, 7 out of 12 specimens from the Colombian and Peruvian Amazonas, three specimens out of five from Tingo Maria, one out of 2 from Guyana, 1 out of two each from the states of Bahia and Mato Grosso, Brazil, and others. Urosternites IV-VI with 3+3 spots , viz., 1+1 anterosubmedian, 1 + 1 anterolateral and 1 + 1 pos terolateral occur in Barro Colorado Island (42 out of 76) Trinidad (1 out Of 18), Peruvian and Colombian Amazonas (5 out of 12), Sinop, Mato Grosso (1 out of 2), Bahia (1 out of 2) and others. The extreme is found in specimens with 4+4 small spots (not counting the spiracu lar area which is also frequently darkened), viz., anterosubmedian, posterosubmedian, ante rolateral and posterolateral . We have found this pattern mainly in Trinidad (17 out of 18 specimens) and in one specimen from the Venezuelan state of Miranda. We have also seen a specimen with the small spots reduced to the anterosubmedian one from Chavantina, Mato Grosso. There is great varia tion not only in the number but also in the relative size of the various spots mentioned . All morphologi- . cal details inclusive those of the diagnostic male genitalia of the above specimens agree, and we are confident that a single species is involved. The comparatively high frequency of an extreme pattern (4+4 small spots in 17 specimens out of 18) in a geographically well circumscribed and isolated area (Trinidad) suggests the possible existence of geographic races in this species.

MALE GENITALIA: Endosoma processes present in two pairs, those of proximal pair delicately denticulate apically. TYPES: Of rufotuberculatus, British Museum (Natural History); of coxo-rufa, unknown. DISTRIBUTION: Bolivia; Brazil (Amazonas, Para, Mato Grosso); Colombia; Costa Rica; Ec uador; Panama; Peru; Venezuela). BIOLOGY: Panstrongylus rufotuberculatus has been recorded as naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. It is attracted to light (mostly males) and known to occur in houses but there is no evidence that it breeds there. Sylvatic specimens have been taken from the shelter of a kinkajou (Potos jiavus Schreber, Procyonidae). OBSERVATIONS: This species is somewhat variable morphologically and chromatically. Most specimens have comparatively large eyes (ratio width of eye to synthlipsis 1:1.3-1.8 [fig245A, B]) but in a sample of a population from the Valle de la Convenci6n in the Peruvian Department of Cuzco the eyes are notably smaller (male, 1:2.8, female, 1:3.3 [fig245E, F]). Regarding color, there is some variation in the carinae limiting the central depression of the scutellum; they are red in all specimens from Panama and Colombia, but black as the rest of the body of the scutellum in the specimens from Costa Rica, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil we have seen now. The variability described seems to be geographical in nature.

BIOLOGY: The few specimens known were collected in human habitations, where they can be presumed to have taken temporary refuge. The sylvatic habits of Panstrongylus tupynambai are not known. OBSERVATIONS: In the original description, P. tupynambai was compared with P. guentheri (as P. larroussei) but it actually is more similar to P. lutzi with which it shares the presence ofdenticles on the lateral endosoma processes, the denticles being absent in guentheri. Pan strongylus tupynambai differs from all other Panstrongylus by the length ratios of the first two rostral segments, the first being as long as or even slightly longer than the second, whereas it is invariably and distinctly shorter than the second segment in all other species.

TYPES: Of hirsuta , National Museum of Nat ural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washing ton, D. C.; of kamiensis, papagoensis, yumanensis and pimae, unknown.
DISTRIBUTION: U.S.A. (Arizona, California, Nevada); Mexico (Baja California Sur, Sonora). BIOLOGY: Paratriatoma hirsuta has never been found naturally infected with Try panosoma cruzi, but is easily infected experi mentally. Woodrats (Neotoma spp.) are the only known natural hosts of the species, viz., Neotoma albigula Hartley, N. albigula venusta, N. fuscipes macrotis Thomas, N. l. lepida Thomas, and N. lepida grinelli.
DISCUSSION: This is a chromatically variable species. The various populations described as subspecies by Ryckman represent color forms restricted each to a circumscribed geographical area. 

RHODNIINI PINTO Rhodniini Pinto, 1926a, p. 490. Psammolestiini (sic) Carcavallo, 1976, p. 348 (nomen nudum).
Small- to medium-sized Triatominae of not more than 26 mm, somewhat compressed dor soventrally or not. Body surface from smooth to moderately rugose, with very short bristles only. Head not strongly convex above. Anten niferous tubercles without apical spinelike pro jection. Antennae inserted near apex of head. Genae from slightly to considerably surpassing apex of clypeus, the latter slightly but distinctly widened apically. Ocelli situated pos terolaterally behind eyes, in most cases inserted on conspicuous elevations behind interocular sulcus, the latter not fully developed. Head laterally behind eyes with callosities beset with setiferous tubercles. Second antennal segment with 4-6 trichobothria arranged in one row along length of article, and two ancillary trichobothria laterad of base of main row. Remaining setae of second antennal segment of uniform size. Anterolateral corners of scutellum each with small, polished mammiform process. Corium with veins distinct. Abdomen with urostemites covering part or all of ventral connexival segments, connected to latter by simple membrane. MALE GENITALIA: Articulatory apparatus with basal plate bridge well developed. Basal plate struts transformed into short, platelike, curved or convoluted structures. Dorsal sclero tization of phallosoma large, subsemielliptical. Vesica not strongly sclerotized. Fifth instar nymph: Body surface rugose granulose, with short simple spinulose setae; head not strongly convex above; genae slightly surpassing apex of clypeus; eyes situated well behind middle of head; antenniferous tubercles without conspicuous apicolateral process; fourth antenna} segment shorter than some of the pre ceding; only fourth antennal segment delicately annulate; stridulatory sulcus present; femora subcylindrical or incrassate and compressed, but without denticles, trichobothria absent; fore tarsi much shorter than half the length of tibiae; abdomen without series of large tubercles dor sally along middle. First instar nymph: Head, thorax, and legs mottled with light and dark, in addition to other markings; setae simple or spinulose; fourth an tennal segment not longer than first, second, and third combined; stridulatory sulcus present; metanotum longer at middle than at sides; metanotal plates small, distance between plates larger than twice their width; femora without trichobothria; hind tarsi apically without spe cialized hairs; setae of urotergites irregularly scattered. Eggs laid in masses or singly. TYPE GENUS: Rhodnius Stal, 1859. Other genus included: Psammolestes Bergroth, 1911. DISTRIBUTION: Southern Mexico, Central America, South America to Argentina. BIOLOGY: In birds nests and on palm trees; a few species associated with mammals, or per idomestic and domestic. OBSERVATIONS: This tribe contains two closely related genera. The postocular cal losities, the short ancillary series of trichobothria on the second antennal segment, and the characteristically modified basal plate struts are synapomorphic characters not shared by any other triatomine genus, and sufficient to char acterize the tribe. Carcavallo-(1976) included the name Psam molestiini in a list of triatomine tribes of the Americas. There is no statement giving differ ential characters for the taxon, there is no refer ence to such a statement, and Psammolestiini is not proposed as a replacement name; therefore, Psammolestiini is to be considered as a nomen nudum. In any case, the close relationship be tween Rhodnius and Psammolestes does not justify the segregation of Psammolestes on the tribal level.

DISTRIBUTION: Ecuador and northern Peru. BIOLOGY: Rhodnius ecuadoriensis has been found naturally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. The species is domestic and peridomestic, having also been collected in guinea pig pens and in hollow trees. Its domestic habitats seem to be of very recent origin. 0BSERV A TION: Rhodnius ecuadoriensis shares with R. pictipes and R. pallescens the mottling on the legs and other body parts, and the well-developed 2+2 carinae on the basal portion of the scutellum; it is probably more closely related to these species than to others of the genus.

MALE GENITALIA: Median process of pygophore shortly subtriangular, wide at base, pointed apically . TYPE: Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Ja neiro. DISTRIBUTION: Brazil (Bahia, Goias, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo). BIOLOGY: This species is predominantly syl vatic and has been found in the crown of palm trees, such as the babau (Orbignya maritima Barb.), the macaubeira (Acrocomia macrocarpa Martius), the buriti (Mauritia vinifera Martius) and the aricuri (Schee/ea phalerata Burrel); it is encountered on rare occasions in birds nests belonging to the family Furnariidae, (Anumbius annumbi) and sometimes in clusters of the piteira Fourcraea gigantea Vent. (Amaryllidaceae), or in hollow trees. The species is also found in human habitations, chicken houses, pigeon coops, and in other peridomes tic situations. It is obviously on the way to becoming a truly domestic species. Rhodnius neglectus has been found naturally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. In the laboratory, this species proves to be very active and aggressive, moving quickly and abruptly.

MALE GENITALIA: Median process of pygophore wide, deeply emarginated, bispinose . TYPES: Of pictipes, Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet, Stockholm; of limosus, British Museum (Natural History); of amazonicus, ln stituto de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Manaus. DISTRIBUTION: Belize; Bolivia; Brazil (Ama zonas, Goias, Mato Grosso, Para); Colombia; Ecuador; French Guiana; Guyana; Peru; Su rinam; Trinidad; Venezuela. The record from Belize (Bengue Viejo, Fa ther Stanton; AMNH, one male) extends the range of the species considerably, because it was previously known only from South Amer ica. BIOLOGY: This is a basically sylvatic spe cies, found on palm trees (Schee/ea spp.) and in bromeliads (Aechmea spp.) but specimens have also been encountered in human habita tions or captured at light. The species has been found infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. In the laboratory, R. pic tipes is not an agile species such as, for in stance, R. prolixus; when bothered it will become immobilized and feign death, in a vari ety of unusual positions. OBSERVATIONS: According to its authors, Rhodnius amazonicus is close to R. pictipes from which it differs mainly by the uniformly dark femora and the apparent absence of mot tling on any dark area. We have not been able to examine the type of R. amazonicus, but Dr. W. E. Kerr, Director of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia and to whom we are much obliged, arranged for us to see photo graphs of the type, and obviously very poorly preserved specimen. The photographs do show that a faint mottled pattern is present on the head and thorax (contrary to the information in the original description), but the femora are indeed dark; however, the hind legs are absent, and in dark or poorly preserved specimens of R. pictipes it is only the posterior femora that show traces of the characteristic mottling. A further doubt about the validity of amazonicus arises from the fact that only a single specimen was collected among the many R. pictipes attracted to light at the type locality. We con clude that Rhodnius amazonicus is an abnormal or poorly preserved specimen of Rhodnius pieripes, and therefore synonymize the two spe cies.

TYPE: Of prolixus, Zoologisches Museum, Berlin DISTRIBUTION: Bolivia; Brazil (Amazonas, Goias, Para); Colombia; Costa Rica; Ecuador; French Guiana; Guatemala; Guyana; Honduras; Mexico; Nicaragua, Panama; El Salvador; Su rinam; Venezuela. The above reference for Honduras is the first for that country (Subirana Yoro [Stakelmann; AMNH], four males, one female). BIOLOOY: This species is well established in human habitations, and a very important vector of Chagas disease in Venezuela, Colombia, and French Guiana. In Venezuela, it is the main vector, and occurs in the entire country, from sea level to 2000 meters elevation. It constitutes about 90 percent of all triatomines taken in houses. The species has also been found in burrows of pacas (Agouti paca [L.]) and armadillos, in chicken houses, pigeon coops, and burrows where infected porcupines (Coendou prehensilis [L.]) lived. Rhodnius pro lixus has furthermore been found associated with various birds, such as Jabiru mycteria (Licht.) and Mycteria americana L. (Ciconiidae). It has been collected on various species of palms, viz., Atta/ea humboldtiana Spruce, Acrocomia sclerocarpa Mart., Coper nicia tectorum and Leopoldina piassaba. These findings are very significant for the understanding of the biology of this Rhodnius. Some of the birds mentioned are migratory and eggs of R. prolixus have been found adhering to their feathers thus possibly facilitating the dispersal of the triatomine. Some of the palm trees men tioned provide fronds used by local people to construct roofs and sidewalls of their houses; Rhodnius nymphs hatched from eggs brought in with the palm fronds will start the domestic cycle of the species. Rhodnius prolixus has become one of the most important laboratory objects for study of insect physiology; the bugs are relatively large and easy to handle, and colonies are easy to establish and to maintain. 0BSERV A TIONS: The collections of the Berlin Museum contain three females of Rhodnius prolixus collected by Otto in La Guayra; all bear the number 2916. One of the specimens has a printed number label, its locality and collector label is handwritten and obviously old, and there are two equally old determina tion labels, probably in StAIs handwriting, as follows: Rhodnius StAl/prolixus Stfil. The other two specimens bear handwritten number labels, and the locality and determination labels are comparatively recent. The first specimen mentioned is herewith designated as lectotype.

MALE GENITALIA: Median process of pygophore narrow, pointed apically . Basal plate struts as shown in figure 281E. TYPE: Faculte de Medecine, Paris. DISTRIBUTION: Bolivia; Brazil (Amazonas, Para); Colombia; Ecuador; French Guiana; Peru; Venezuela. BIOLOGY: Rhodnius robustus has been found naturally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. In Colombia, R. robustus has been reported from houses but it is not a domestic species. In Venezuela, R. robustus is known to occur on the palm Atta/ea maracaibensis Martius, on palms of the genus Schee/ea and on other, unidentified palm trees. Rhodnius robustus has also been taken in epiphytic bromeliads (;t echmea sp. ?) OBSERVATIONS: Rhodnius robustus is very closely related to R. prolixus with which it shares most morphological and chromatic char acters. Small robustus and large prolixus can be difficult to distinguish. The specific status of robustus, however, cannot be doubted, not only because of the striking and constant difference in the color of the hind tibiae of the nymphs IV and V as stated in our key, but also because of the small but apparently constant difference in the shape of the modified basal plate struts of the aedeagus .

TYPE: Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Ja neiro. DISTRIBUTION: Venezuela. BIOLOGY: Psammolestes arthuri is found in nests of Phacellodomus rufifrons inornatus, a bird locally known as cucarachero de monte, or guaiti, and in nests of other, unidentified birds. Specimens have also been collected on palm trees and under the bark of dead trees. The species has been found naturally in fected with Trypanosoma cruzi; abandoned birds nests are frequently inhabited by small mammals which may be hosts of Trypanosoma cruzi and from which Psammolestes might have acquired their infection. This species is not easy to maintain in the laboratory where it feeds with difficulty on chickens and white mice and does not survive long. A saturated atmosphere improves survival time, but colonies could not be maintained per manently.

DISTRIBUTION: Brazil (Bahia, Ceara, Goias, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Para, Parafba, Pemambuco, Sao Paulo). BIOLOOY: This species of Psammolestes is found frequently in nests of birds of the family Fumariidae: Phacellodomus rufifrons rufifrons, P. rufifrons specularis Hellmayr, and Anumbiusannumbi; these birds are locally known as Joaograveto, Joao tenenem cochicho, titiri, casaca-de-couro. Psammolestes ter tius has also been collected from nests of the sabia do campo, Mimus saturninus (Licht.) (Mimidae) located on buriti palms, as well as under bark of the jaqueira (Artocarpus het erophyllus) (Moraceae).
This species lays single eggs adhering to the small sticks used by the birds as nest building materials; the eggs are difficult to perceive due to their cryptic coloring. Psammolestes tertius has been found natu rally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, proba bly acquired from opossums that have been found in abandoned birds nests still inhabited by the triatomine. OBSERVATIONS: Psammolestes tertius is difficult to distinguish from P. coreodes on somatic features alone and we have therefore also in cluded genitalic characters of the male in the descriptions and in our key. Although most specimens examined will fit easily in one or the other species, we have experienced difficulties with Psammolestes from Mato Grosso, Brazil, listed by Lent and Jurberg (1965) as coreodes. The specimens are somewhat intermediate somatically between typical coreodes and tertius, but the male genitalia are indubitably those of tertius, and we are labeling the specimens as such.

TYPE: National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.
DISTRIBUTION: Brazil (Bahia, Espirito Santo, Mato Grosso, Para); Colombia; Ecuador; Pan ama; Venezuela. Cavernicola pilosa is here reported for the first time from Ecuador (Pastaza: Confluence of Rio Macuma and Rio Morona, 300 meters, July 17, 1971 [B. Malkin; the American Museum of Natural History], one male).
BIOLOGY: As for the tribe. The species was found infested by a Trypanosoma closely related to T cruzi. Cavernicola pilosa has beenobtained from shelters of the following bats: Desmodus rotundus (E. Geoffroy); Dirias albiventris Desmarest; Eumops auripendulus (Shaw), Molossus molossus (Pallas) and Sac copteryx bilineatus (Temminck); the triatomine is thought to be involved in transmission of Trypanosoma species to bats. OBSERVATIONS: We have been unable to find any differences that would indicate the presence of more than one species among the abundant material examined. Certain venational anomalies are very fre quent in this species. They are found in the inner cell of the membrane of the hemelytra where spurious veins, either free or forming a cell or cells, are common . Among 42 Panamanian specimens examined at random, 21 had spurious veins. Material from Tolima (Colombia) also showed frequent spu rious veins. We have not seen a comparative phenomenon in any other triatomine bug.

TYPE GENUS: Bolbodera Valdes, 1910. OTHER GENERA INCLUDED: Belminus Stal, 1859; Microtriatoma Prosen and Martinez, 1952; Parabelminus Lent, 1943. DISTRIBUTION: Cuba; Central America north to southern Mexico; South America to 26 de grees south (Map, fig294). BIOLOGY: Arboreal, associated with mar supials or rodents nests, or in bromeliads; very rarely domestic. The eggs are laid singly. OBSERVATIONS: Our cladogram shows the hypothesized relationships between the four genera included in the tribe Bolboderini. The plesiomorphic states for the characters used have been established as such because they represent the nonspecialized con ditions found in other triatomines and in non triatomine reduviids. The most plesiomorphic genus is Bolbodera, with the remaining genera combined forming its sister group. Bolbodera, a relict-endemic, has been found only in Cuba; it is the vicariant of the assemblage of the remaining genera, which occurs in Central and South America. The known distribution of the bolboderine gen era is shown in figure 294. Belminus ranges from southern Mexico to northern Peru, and is roughly sympatric with Microtriatoma although the latter extends to southern Brazil. Parabe/minus, the sister group of Microtriatoma, has so far only been found in a relatively small section of the area of the Brazilian coastal range. Microtriatoma has not been collected in the area where Parabelminus occurs; a vicariance situation may well obtain here. Bolboderines are not well collected, and fu ture findings may change the above picture.

TYPE of scabrosa, Museo Gundlach, La Habana; of cubana, the American Museum of Natural History. DISTRIBUTION: The type of the species is from Cuba, with no exact locality given. The type of Callotriatoma cubana was collected at 3000 at Loma del Gato, in the Oriente prov ince. Alayo (1967) mentioned one specimen from Guantanamo (Oriente) and one from So roa (Pinar del Rfo). Dr. F. Sotolongo, pro fessor of parasitology at Habana University informed us (in litt.) that the species exists in the provinces of Pinar del Rio and La Habana, and that it was also collected in a coffee planta tion in Trinidad (Las Villas).
BIOLOGY: Sotolongo informed us (in litt.) that the material from Las Villas mentioned above was collected in nests of the rodent Ca promys pilorides (Say); Alayo (1967) already suggested that a Capromys, melanurus Peters, might be the host of Bolbodera.

TYPE: National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. DISTRIBUTION: Costa Rica; ?Mexico (Ver acruz). BIOLOGY: Belminus costaricensis has been collected on a sloth (Bradypus sp.) and in nests of Nasutitermes sp. (lsoptera) and Trigona sp. (Apoidea, Hymenoptera), but these are proba bly accidental finds. Beutelspacher (in Litt.) took specimens of what is probably costaricensis in the epiphytic bromeliad Aechmea bracteata (Swartz) Griseb. 0BSERV A TIONS: An adult male from Mexico (Los Tuxtlas Biological Station, Municipio San Andres, Tuxtla, Veracruz) collected with a nymph by C. R. Beutelspacher in a bromeliad possibly belongs to costaricensis. The adult differs from Costa Rican material by its somewhat larger synthlipsis (twice the width of one eye) the slightly more pointed anterolateral processes of the pronotum , the slightly more pronounced tubercles of the fore lobe of the pronotum, and the corium which is distinctly lighter colored than the membrane. All other characters, including the relative length of the first rostral segment and the sulcate scutellar process agree in the Costa Rican and Mexican specimens.

MATERIAL EXAMINED: Panama: Sasardf, Sept., 1968 (A. Herrer; the American Museum of Natural History), one male, holotype, one female, allotype, one nymph; Rio Mono, April, 1970 (A. Herrer; the American Museum of Nat ural History), one nymph. BIOLOGY: The specimens were collected under the bark of a tree (Anacardium sp., Anacar diaceae) in the Panamanian rainforest.
OBSERVATIONS: The types of B. herreri are imperfect specimens, and the above description is a composite. The chromatic characters alone, unique in the genus, are sufficient to character ize the species. Belminus herreri differs morphologically from B. costaricensis and B. rugulosus by the absence of a sulcus on the scutellar process, and from peruvianus, which also has no sulcus, by many characters, such as the shape of the hind lobe of the head and of the fore lobe of the pronotum, and by the relatively longer first rostral segment. ETYMOLOGY: This species is named for Dr. Aristides Herrer, the Peruvian parasitologist; this is the second species of Belminus dis covered by Dr. Herrer.

Abdomen with spiracles close to external margin of sternites. Genitalia as in generic descrption and figure 23F, G. TYPE: Instituto Miguel Lillo, Tucuman. DISTRIBUTION: This species is only known from a small area in the upper Marafi6n valley in Peru, at elevations from 350 to 1300 meters. BIOLOGY: All instars of B. peruvianus were found under loose bark of a large specimen of Schinus molle L. (Anacardiaceae); the tree served as a semipermanent shelter for an q,ossum (Didelphis sp.) and chickens were sleeping a few feet from the tree. Belminus peruvianus was also found, together with Pan strongylus chinai, in thatch-roofed adobe house inhabited by humans, dogs, guinea pigs, and geckos. No epidemiological role could be es tablished for B. peruvianus. Specimens of B. peruvianus were taken to the laboratory on various occasions. Adults and fourth and fifth instar nymphs fed hesitatingly on man, but would accept chicken quite read ily. First instar nymphs hatched in the labora tory refused to feed on humans, rabbits, guinea pigs, or white rats but accepted geckos and tortoises (Geochelone chilensis) (Gray). The most frequently observed mode of feeding of first and second instar nymphs was cannibalism (cleptohaemodeipnonism as defined by Ryck man, 1951), which allowed the nymphs to at tain the second respectively third instar without any other food. One feature peculiar to this species is that it occurs in a semiarid region (the upper Marafi6n Valley), whereas all other Bolboderini appear to be restricted to areas of high rainfall. It is also the only Bolboderini known to have made the transition from a sylvatic to a peridomestic and domestic way of life.

TYPES: Of rugulosus, Zoologisches Mu seum, Berlin; of diminutus, British Museum (Natural History). DISTRIBUTION: Colombia, Venezuela. BIOLOGY: Unknown. 0BSERV A TIO NS: The above redescription is based upon the examination of the types of rugulosus and diminutus. The collections of the Berlin Museum con tain three females of rugulosus, collected by Moritz in Columbien and all bearing a label with the number 2913. Only one of the three specimens bears a printed number label, an obviously old handwritten locality label, and similar identification labels, possibly in Stals handwriting, as follows: Belminus Stal/ rugulosus Stal. The three specimens are very similar and appear conspecific. We herewith designate the female bearing the original determination labels as the lectotype.

TYPE SPECIES: Parabelminus carioca Lent. DISTRIBUTION: Southeastern Brazil. BIOLOGY: Arboreal, among fronds of palm trees and in epiphytic bromeliads, probably associated with opossums and rodents. Parabelminus are able to climb smooth sur faces, doubtlessly aided by the three pairs of spongy fossulae. OBSERVATIONS: Although compared origi nally by Lent (1943c) to Belminus and Bolbodera, Parabelminus is actually closest to Microtriatoma, the first species of which was not described before 1951. Parabelminus and Microtriatoma share a number of apomorphic characters which make their recent common origin a certainty. The two genera are very close, even as to the color pattern of their species, and differ mainly by different ratios of various of their body parts , the loss of the scutellar spine in Parabelminus, and the absence of denticles on the legs in Microtriatoma (present in Para belminus).

GENITALIA: Of male and female as in ge neric description; genitalia of male as illustrated .
TYPE: Instituto Oswaldo Cruz. DISTRIBUTION: Parabelminus carioca is only known from a hillside within the city limits of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
BIOLOGY: The type species of the genus was found on a palm tree (Atta/ea indaya [Drude]) among its frond where opossums (Didelphis marsupialis aurita Wied) were obtaining shel ter .. Both the vertebrate host and the insect were found to be infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. Together with these triatomines, several specimens of the reduviine Aradomorpha cham pioni Lent and Wygodzinsky were encountered; we suspect that Aradomorpha may prey on the Parabelminus.

MATERIAL EXAMINED: Brazi1: Bahia: Sao Felipe, Fazenda Velha, Oct. 27, 1974 (T Bar rett, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz), one female, holo type, one male, allotype, three males, paratypes; ibid. (T Barrett; the American Museum of Natural History), one male, one female, paratypes, several nymphs; Castro Alves, Fazenda Taperinha, Sept. 21, 1976 (T Barrett; Instituto Oswaldo Cruz), one fifth instar nymph; Castro Alves, Fazenda da Serra, August 22, 1975 (T Barrett, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz), three females, paratypes; Itabuna, CEPLAC, Aug. 20, 1976 (T Barrett; Instituto Oswaldo Cruz), one female, paratype; Irara, F. Durao, near Salvador, Oct. 22, 1951 (L. C. Mendona; Instituto Oswaldo Cruz), one female, paratype. BIOLOGY: The following is based on information provided us by T Barrett to whom we are much obliged. Most specimens collected were found in epiphytic bromeliads, mostly Aechmea multiftora L. B. Smith, but one specimen was found on the trunk of a tree where two different bromeliads (Hohenbergia sp. and Aechmea sp.) grew in association. The bro meliads in some cases contained rodent nests, and frogs and geckos also occurred. Although P. yurupucu was found associated with Tri atoma tibiamaculata and Rhodnium domesticus and both of the last two were infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, none of the 31 specimens of Parabelminus examined were infected. The eggs of P. yurupucu adhere to the substrate. In the laboratory, nymphs fed on mice. ETYMOLOGY: The specific name is taken from the Guarani yurupucu, long-nosed, a com mon name for triatomines in the Guarani lan guage area.

Fifth instar nymph: With the characters of the tribe; most setae scalelike; first rostral segment much shorter than second; genae platelike, laterally compressed, apex rounded in lateral view; femora without denticles; tibiae with spongy fossulae on all pairs; tarsi very short, about as long as diameter of tibiae api cally. TYPE SPECIES: Microtriatoma trinidadensis (Lent) (as Microtriatoma mansosotoi Prosen and Martinez). DISTRIBUTION: Central America from Costa Rica to Panama; South America from Trinidad to Peru and Bolivia, as well as southern Brazil. This is by far the widest range of any bolboderine genus. We have examined a nymph of Micro triatoma not asociated with adults and therefore not identifiable specifically (Costa Rica: Juan Vinas [USNM]). Because so little is known about the genus, we are listing this nymph as it widens the known geographical range of Micro triatoma. BIOLOGY: Arboreal, in bromeliads; associ ated with opossums. 0BSERVA TIONS: As shown under the heading of Parabelminus, that genus and Microtriatoma are closely related. Microtriatoma could be considered to be the more plesiomorphic genus because it has not lost its scutellar spine, whereas Parabelminus has; on the other hand, the absence in Microtriatoma of denticles on the femora and the overall small size might be taken to be apomorphic characters.
KEY TO THE SPECIES OF Microtriatoma1 I. Membrane of hemelytra speckled with light and dark ; head slender in lateral view ; postocular region of head at most 1.6 times as wide as long ; third rostral segment much shorter than first (0-7-0.8: 1.0) ........... trinidadensis Membrane of hemelytra uniformly dark ; head stout in lateral view ; postocular region of head very short, 1.8 times as wide as long ; third rostral segment as long as first . borbai ...............................

Microtriatoma borbai, new species Figures 314, 315 DIAGNOSIS: A species distinguished from trinidadensis, the only other species of the genus, mainly by the very short hind lobe of the head, the comparatively longer third rostral segment, and the uniformly dark membrane of the hemelytra DESCRIPTION.

Pronotum as in trinidadensis; anterolateral angles pointed in most specimens . Hemelytra and hind wings as in trinidadensis, but membrane of hemelytra concolorous dark . Apex of hemelytra of male approaching posterior border of tergite VII, of female shorter, closer to basal than to posterior border of tergite VII. Male genitalia with fused portion of struts narrow, parallel-sided for most of its length . Legs as in trinidadensis. DISTRIBUTION: Brazil (Parana). MATERIAL EXAMINED: Brazi1: Parana: Curitiba, August 1970 (A. Borba; Instituto Os waldo Cruz) one male, holotype, two males, paratypes; ibid. (the American Museum of Natural History), one female, allotype, four males, paratypes. BIOLOGY: Dr. A. Borba, of the School of Medicine, University of Parana, Curitiba (Brazil), discovered (personal commun.) a small population near Curitiba in clusters of bro meliads, where he also found shelters of q,ossums (Didelphis sp.) and of rodents. In the laboratory, the specimens of Microtriatoma refused to feed on pigeons, chickens, mice, or humans. One of the specimens was found to be infested by Trypanosoma cruzi. Nymphs of Phimophorus spissicornis Bergroth, an ento mophagous reduviid bug, were found associated with the Microtriatoma.
ETYMOLOGY: The species is named for its collector.

TYPES: Of trinidadensis, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro; of mansosotoi, Misi6n de Estudios de Patologfa Regional, Buenos Aires. DISTRIBUTION: In addition to Trinidad, the species has also been reported, or now exam ined by us, from Barro Colorado Island, Panama (American Museum of Natural His tory); Surinam: Paramaribo (Leyden Museum); Venezuela: Sucre; Colombia: Meta; Peru: Mon son Valley, Tingo Maria (California Academy of Sciences); Bolivia: Chapare and Santa Cruz de la Sierra; and Brazi1: Sinop, Mato Grosso (the American Museum of Natural History); Para: Utinga, near Belem, opossum nest (M. A. Miles; the American Museum of Natural History). BIOLOGY: Specimens obtained in Trinidad and Bolivia were collected at light, and those from Colombia under tree bark. Venezuelan material was found in an epiphytic bromeliad, together with specimens of Rhodnius robustus . OBSERVATIONS: We have here synonymized M. mansosotoi with M. trinidadensis, because the differential characters given by the authors of the first species and those presented in the key by Carcavallo et al. (1976) are either subject to variation or have been interpreted er roneously. The shape of the head is quite variable within certain parameters and does not allow us to place given specimens unequivocally in one or the other of the two previously named species. The same applies to the remaining characters used by the above authors, as well as several others we have ex plored ourselves. Future work based upon a much more extensive material than that available now, reared if possible, and perhaps a careful study of the male genitalia, may require a reconsideration of our procedure but the data available at this time suggest the presence of a widespread species occupying most of the range of the genus.
