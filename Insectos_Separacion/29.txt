Overall color dark brown or black , with yellow or orange spots on neck , rarely on humeri , on corium and on connexivum . Setae abundant , 0 . 1-0 . 3 mm long . Head black , weakly granulose , shallowly rugose transversally along center above , with numerous forwardly inclined setae . Head two to two and one-half times as long as wide ( 1 : 0 . 4-0 . 5 ) and from longer to very slightly shorter than pronotum ( l : 0 . 85-1 . 05 ) . Anteocular region about three times as long as postocular ( 1 : 0 . 30-0 . 35 ) ; postocular with sides subparallel , very slightly rounded . Clypeus narrow anteriorly , shortly and abruptly widened on basal half . Genae narrowly tapering apically , either attaining but not surpassing level of apex of clypeus , or falling slightly short of it . Eyes in side view from barely attaining to slightly surpassing level of under surface and distant from level of upper surface of head . Ratio width of eye to synthlipsis of male 1 : 1 . 4-2 . 1 , of female 1 : 2 . 1-2 . 5 , viz . , eyes of males larger than those of females . Antenniferous tubercles situated slightly behind middle of anteocular region of head . First antennal segment from attaining to slightly surpassing level of apex of clypeus ; second segment with decumbent stiff setae about as long as diameter of segment . Ratio of antennal segments 1 : 2 . 5-2 . 9 : 2 . 0 : 1 . 8 . Rostral segments stout , cylindrical , with short setae but hairs longer than diameter of segment on third . Ratio of rostral segments 1 : 1 . 45-1 . 55 : 0 . 5- 0 . 6 . Rostrum dark reddish brown to black . Neck laterally with I+ I orange-red markings . Pronotum uniformly dark brown or black , in some specimens with small orange spot on humeri . Pronotum not granulose , with stiff setae from very short ( 0 . 1 mm ) and adpressed to longer ( up to 0 . 3 mm ) and semierect . Structure of pronotum and scutellum as in phyllosoma ; scutellum uniformly dark . Mesostemum with numerous long erect hairs ; metastemum with similar hairs in large or small number , or only with short decumbent setae . Hemelytra and wings fully developed although appearing narrow as compared to unusually wide abdomen , leaving extreme lateral portions of urotergites exposed . Hemelytra of males attaining middle or apex of urotergite VII , those of female reaching but not extending beyond hind margin of urotergite VI . Corium with short ( 0 . 1 mm ) adpressed setae , or somewhat longer ( 0 . 2 mm ) decumbent ones . Corium black , with large triangular basal marking yellow or orange colored , and with smaller subapical spot of similar color , the latter mark in some specimens very small or imperceptible . Clavus entirely dark . Legs as in phyllosoma ; fore femora 6 . 1-6 . 9 times as long as wide . Venter convex , delicately but shallowly striate transversally ; pilosity of venter varying from short and decumbent ( in specimens with short setae on metastemum ) to long and semierect ( in specimens with long hairs on metasternum ) . Spiracles remote from connexival suture by one to several times their diameter . Connexivum dark brown or black , each segment on posterior half or third with yellow or orange-red irregularly shaped marking adjoining abdominal margin and extending or not to connexival suture . Spots similar on dorsal and ventral surface ; ventral spots in some cases extending very shortly to posterolateral comer of respective urostemite .
