Length of male 18 . 5-21 . 0 mm , of female 21-24 mm ; width of pronotum of male 5 . 0-5 . 5 mm , of female 5-6 mm ; width of abdomen of male 6-7 mm , of female 7 . 0-7 . 5 mm Overall color from dark brown to black , with connexivum and portions of adjacent urostemites orange yellow or rarely pale yellow colored . Head and thorax from highly polished to rarely dull . Body hairs short except long hairs on appendages . Head very dark , transversally rugose dorsally and irregularly so laterally , very weakly granulose ; less than twice as long as wide ( l : 0 . 6-0 . 7 ) and longer than pronotum ( l : 0 . 8-0 . 9 ) . Anteocular region three times as long as postocular ( l : 0 . 3-0 . 35 ) ; postocular with sides faintly convex , slightly converging toward behind . Clypeus narrow , slightly widened at apex and gradually so on posterior half . Genae blunt apically , attaining level of apex of clypeus . Jugae short , wideangled apically . Eyes large , in lateral view surpassing level of lower surface but distant from level of upper surface of head . Ratio width of eyes to synthlipsis 1 : 1 . 4-1 . 9 . Ocelli very large , their length equal to their distance from eye . Antenniferous tubercles situated at middle of anteocular portion of head . First antennal segment from almost attaining to very slightly surpassing level of apex of clypeus . Second antennal segment as in spinolai , viz . , with numerous semierect ciliate hairs about twice as long as diameter of segment and less numerous setae from twice to more than four times as long as diameter of segment ; similar hairs and setae on third and fourth segments . Ratio of antennal segments 1 : 3 . 3-4 . 0 : 2 . 6-3 . 0 : 1 . 5-1 . 8 . Rostrum reddish brown , lighter than head capsule . Rostral segments slender , compressed dorsoventrally ; first and second segments with hairs approximately as long as diameter of segments , but much longer than diameter of segments on apex of second dorsally and on entire third segment . Ratio of rostral segments 1 : 1 . 6-1 . 8 : 0 . 5-0 . 6 . Neck somewhat lighter than head capsule , with 1 + 1 small distinct yellow spots laterally . Pronotum uniformly dark , its surface in most cases highly polished , rarely only slightly polished or dull . Anterior lobe feebly sculptured , with 1 + 1 low but invariably distinct discal tubercles ; lateral tubercles small , variable , from perceptible to absent . Posterior lobe irregularly rugose and wrinkled . Submedian carinae extending to posterior third of hind lobe . Humeri angular , from slightly projecting to conspicuously flaring and explanate ; invariably pointed . Anterolateral projections small , from blunt to narrowly conical . Scutellum with surface heavily rugose , its median depression ill defined , from narrowly linear to absent . Posterior scutellar process half as long as main body of scutellum , very narrowly conical , sharply tapered distally , its apex in most specimens obliquely elevated . Mesosternum limited posteriorly by prominent straight transverse carina . Metasternum longitudinally carinate along middle and behind . Hemelytra attaining apex of abdomen . Corium dark brown or black ; membrane fumose , somewhat lighter brown . Legs uniformly dark brown , slender . Fore femur 6 . 5-8 . 5 times as long as wide . Femora inermous . Fore and mid tibiae of male with spongy fossula , absent in female . Femora of fore legs and frequently but not invariably also those of mid and hind legs with scattered but distinct long setae ; similar but very numerous setae on all tibiae . Venter convex , in female flattened longitudinally along middle but not sharply so . Venter minutely striate transversally , and with fine semierect setae on posterior segments . Spiracles adjoining connexival suture . Connexivum orange or rarely pale yellow , with areas of lighter color slightly advancing onto urosternites along intersegmental sutures . Disc of connexival segments with large dark spot occupying entire width of connexivum ; light areas of connexivum straddling intersegmental sutures , varying from smaller to larger than dark portions .
