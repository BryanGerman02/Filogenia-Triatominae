Triatoma recurva nigricollis : Ryckman and Ryckman , 1967b , p . 383 . Length of males 25 . 5-30 . 0 mm , of females 29-33 mm ; width of pronotum of males 5 . 5-7 . 0 mm , of females 6 . 0-7 . 5 mm ; width of abdomen of males 8 . 5-10 . 5 mm , of females 11 . 0-13 . 5 mm General color from piceous to black , in some cases hind lobe of pronotum slightly lighter colored ; connexivum orange-yellow along outer margin . Setae short and sparse , inconspicuous . Head narrow , rugose transversally along middle on dorsum , faintly granulose , slightly more than twice as long as wide across eyes ( 1 : 0 . 40-0 . 45 ) , and longer than pronotum ( 1 : 0 . 9 ) . Anteocular region from three to four times as long as postocular ( l : 0 . 25-0 . 35 ) , postocular with sides straight , slightly converging toward behind . Clypeus very narrow , gradually widened behind its middle . Genae pointed apically , falling short of apex of clypeus . In side view , eyes approaching but not attaining level of upper surface but extending below level of lower surface of head . In dorsal view , ratio width of eyes to synthlipsis l : 1 . 4-1 . 7 . Antenniferous tubercles situated slightly behind middle of anteocular region , without apical spiniferous process . First antennal segment falling short of apex of clypeus . Second segment only with decumbent setae . Ratio of antennal segments 1 : 3-3 . 5 : 2 . 4-2 . 7 : 2 . 1-2 . 3 . Rostrum slender , first and second segments with very short , sparse setae , third with a few long hairs . First segment attaining level of base of antenniferous tubercles , second attaining level of base of neck . Ratio of rostral segments 1 : 1 . 6-1 . 8 : 0 . 5 . Neck light colored laterally . Pronotum with sides conspicuously constricted at level of transversal sulcus . Anterior lobe with halves distinctly convex , delicately granulose , with 1 + 1 discal tubercles and 1 + 1 less well developed but still perceptible lateral tubercles . Posterior lobe shallowly rugose , submedian carinae not attaining posterior margin of pronotum . Humeri narrowly rounded . Anterolateral angles shortly conical , rounded apically . Scutellum heavily rugose , with central portion only slightly depressed ; apical process elongate cylindrical , almost as long as disc of sclerite , horizontal , its apex slightly tapering , from horizontal to slightly downward bent . Hemelytra uniformly dark , those of male attaining or slightly surpassing apex of abdomen , those of female only attaining base or at most middle of urotergite VIII . Hemelytra narrow compared to wide abdomen , in females leaving lateral portions of urotergites exposed . Legs slender and elongate , only with short sparse setae . Fore femora 7 . 5-10 . 0 times as long as wide . Fore and mid femora with 1 + 1 larger and occasionally 1 + 1 smaller subapical denticles . Fore and mid tibiae of males with small spongy fossulae , absent in females . Abdomen convex below . Venter delicately striate transversally ; setae inconspicuous . Spiracles very close to connexival suture , their distance from suture equal to once or twice their diameter . Connexivum wide , in many specimens strongly reflexed . Connexivum dark , with orange-yellow outer margin dorsally and ventrally , this margin in many specimens wider toward posterior portion of each segment ; light color in some cases slightly extended mesad along intersegmental connexival sutures .
