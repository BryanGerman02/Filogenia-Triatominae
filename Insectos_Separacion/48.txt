Length of male 13 . 0-19 . 5 , of female 15-23 mm ; width of pronotum of male 3 . 5-4 . 0 , of female 3 . 5-5 . 0 mm , width of abdomen of male 5 . 0-5 . 5 , of female 5 . 0-8 . 5 mm Color either from piceous to black , with intersegmental connexival sutures light , and membrane in . some cases light gray , or from light to dark brown , with connexival sutures as above or with entire connexivum from slightly to distinctly lighter than rest of abdomen . Head granulose and slightly rugose , distinctly convex above , about twice as long as wide across eyes ( 1 : 0 . 45- 0 . 55 ) , and about as long as pronotum . Anteocular region slightly less than three times as long as postocular ( 1 : 0 . 34-0 . 4 ) , postocular with sides rounded . Clypeus narrow anteriorly , strongly widened on posterior half . Head with distinct arcuate transverse impression at base of clypeus . Genae narrowly tapered apically , not attaining level of apex of clypeus . Upper surface of head evenly convex above , but in side view with slight although distinct depression at level of base of clypeus . Head not salient ventrally behind eyes . Eyes in lateral view attaining levels of upper or lower surface of head . Eyes comparatively small , ratio width of eye to synthlipsis 1 : 3 . 25-3 . 60 . Antenniferous tubercles situated at level of center of anteocular region . First antennal segment very short , barely exceeding middle of distance between its base and level of apex of clypeus . Second segment only with short , adpressed setae . Ratio of antennal segments 1 : 2 . 70-2 . 95 : 2 . 20-2 . 55 : 1 . 95- 2 . 30 . Rostrum with short hairs becoming progressively longer toward apex of second segment , uniformly long on third segment , but not forming dense brushlike structure at junction of second and third . First segment attaining level of center of antenniferous tubercle , second attaining level of neck . Ratio of rostral segments 1 : 1 . 15-1 . 30 : 0 . 50 . Neck dark , light colored anterolaterally . Pronotum from light brown to black , smooth , carinate laterally , trapezoidal , only very slightly constricted at level of transverse sulcus . Anterior lobe only slightly elevated , without discal or lateral tubercles , slightly granulose . Posterior lobe rugose , submedian carinae almost attaining hind margin ; humeri rounded . Anterolateral angles very short , inconspicuous , rounded apically . Scutellum with central portion depressed , limited by distinct carinae . Apical process about half as long as main body of scutellum , subconical , faintly depressed dorsoventrally , its pointed apex deflected . Hemelytra almost attaining apex of abdomen , their color from brownish in light colored to almost black in dark specimens , in some cases membrane lighter than corium , and the latter with faint light-colored subapical spot ; rarely center of corium darker than rest of hemelytra . Legs short and stout ; fore femora from four to five times as long as wide . Fore and mid femora subapically with two pairs of denticles . Tibiae of both sexes without spongy fossulae . Venter rounded or slightly flattened , irregularly wrinkled transversally . Hairs of venter inconspicuous . Spiracles close to connexival suture . General color of abdomen as on rest of body , from light reddish brown to black ; intersegmental sutures of dark specimens in most cases narrowly yellow . Brownish forms frequently with connexivum contrastingly very light brown or yellow , in other specimens concolorous with urostemites .
