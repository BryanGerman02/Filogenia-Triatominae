Body surface appearing glabrous . Head uniformly light colored , or , in some specimens , dorsum with l + l narrow dark submedian stripes extending from base of jugae to space between ocelli . Dorsal surface of head shallowly rugose . Anterior portion of head conspicuously upturned . Head about one and one-half times as long as wide across eyes ( l : 0 . 70-0 . 75 ) , and distinctly shorter than pronotum ( l : l . 15-1 . 30 ) . Anteocular region about twice as long as postocular ( l : 0 . 45-0 . 55 ) ; postocular with sides straight , slightly converging toward behind . Clypeus only slightly widened posteriorly . Genae very narrowly tapering apically , attaining level of apex of clypeus . Jugae short , angular , with incipient hook-shaped process . Head convex above between eyes , in lateral view . Eyes in lateral view extending below level of under surface but distant from level of upper surface of head . Ratio width of eyes to synthlipsis l : l . 45-1 . 9 . Ocellar tubercles black at base . Antenniferous tubercles dark , with pronounced apicolateral process . Antennae from reddish brown to black . First antennal segment slightly extending beyond level of apex of clypeus ; second segment with stiff inclined setae about as long as diameter of segment , as well as with numerous sensory hairs . Ratio of antennal segments l : 3 . 0-3 . 7 : 2 . 35- 2 . 80 : 2 . 5-2 . 7 . Rostrum dark brown . First rostral segment approaching or extending to or slightly beyond level of anterior margin of eyes ; second rostral segment attaining level of middle of neck . First and under surface of second rostral segment with very short inconspicuous setae ; upper surface of second and entire third segment with hairs about as long as diameter of respective segment . Ratio of rostral segments l : l . 0-1 . 3 : 0 . 45-0 . 55 . Pronotum light orangebrown . Collar with or without dark area . Anterior lobe of pronotum with central black marking in shape of four leaf clover , and l + 1 lateral black markings in shape of interrupted H ; in some specimens short dark marking extending from base of H onto posterior lobe . Posterior lobe with black band along posterior margin except at humeral area , this band parallel sided or with anterior projections . Anterior lobe slightly convex , elevated areas low , faintly rugose . Discal and lateral tubercles from small to obsolescent . Posterior lobe irregularly rugose ; submedian carinae in most specimens evanescent on posterior half of hind lobe . Humeral angles rounded . Anterolateral projections of pronotum shortly subconical , rounded apically . Scutellum and its process black , sublateral callosities limiting shallow median depression orange-yellow ; apex of process in some specimens light colored . Process large , as long as or slightly longer than main body of scutellum , narrowly cylindrical , horizontal , its apex rounded and in some specimens slightly deflected . Pleura and sterna of general body color , with dark markings . Hemelytra attaining apex of abdomen , in both sexes ; their overall color light brown or light yellowish brown , with veins , especially those of membrane , conspicuously darker . Corium as light as or slightly lighter than membrane , dark at extreme apex . In some specimens , corium and membrane mottled with small dark spots . Legs with fore femur about five and one-half times as long as wide . Fore and mid femora with 2-6 ( most frequently 4 ) small subapical denticles arranged in two rows . Spongy fossulae on fore and mid tibiae in both sexes , those of males larger , about as long as diameter of article , those of females not more than half as long as diameter of tibia apically . Coxae and trochantera light yellow or orange-yellow . Femora and tibiae dark brown or black , femora with short , orange apical annulus , in many specimens a similar though shorter annulus on base of tibiae . Apex of tibiae in some specimens also with short reddish annulus . Venter convex , not flattened distinctly on disc ; urosternites delicately striate transversally . Setae of venter short , sparse , inconspicuous . Spiracles close to connexival suture , distant from the latter by not more than their own diameter . Suture between urosternites II and III obsolescent . Overall color of abdomen light orangebrown , with pattern formed by large median and smaller sublateral and lateral spots as shown in figures 2198 ; 22IE . Connexivum light yellowish brown with black subrectangular marks on anterior third of dorsal connexival plates , of varied shape , frequently indented posteriorly . Dark markings on ventral portion of connexivum larger than on dorsal surface . MALE GENITALIA : Vesica without conspicuous lateral projections . Lateral endosoma processes wide , subapically below with field of small denticles .
